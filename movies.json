    "review": "Between the narration and the imagery evokes school shootings as much as it does its more direct, more famous successor (9/11). Terrorism as the only way to break through and reach people in the era of mass media, as evoked by mass media gawking at the spectacle of terrorism in increasingly depraved ways. 25 Americans dead by terrorism- 12,000 dead by slipping in their bathtub."
