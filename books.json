It only took the French to do it. A massive credit goes to the translator, who manages to imbue a lot of these poems with actual clever and beautiful turns of phrase; unclear to this non-French speaker how much of that is from the original, but found myself liking the prose on its terms throughout. Maybe all it took was leaving behind the shackles of rhyming.\n The content of these is a bit of a strange mix that feels like it could only authentically come from the period that it does; reflections on urbanity and the city, as well as general horniness, that feels shockingly modern, all while having a religious and mythological slant to it that feels like it could not be borne out of the modern age. In general just a really fun energy and life to the poems; Baudelaire has a sense of humor that can be pretty caustic/cynical/sarcastic/nasty that still maintains good humor about itself and remain self-deprecating at the same time. In one of the poems he says to be drunk at all times, not necessarily of alcohol but of experience, and these poems feel like that at times, a ride through ideas with good humor and verve to them."},"bleedingedge": {"title": "Bleeding Edge", "stars": "4", "day_read": "2025/12/23", "author": "Thomas Pynchon", "review": "Pynchon does 9/11 is about as good of a tagline as it gets for me to be interested, despite this being seen as maybe the least of his works.

Even if retains some of its fundamental weirdness (and its ghosts), it’s still liable to be sold off, ruined, disappeared, something anyone who’s been on the Internet for longer than 5 years knows. Try to use it for good, be ready for it to be corrupted and turned into ad space; you can either sell it the highest evil bidder or give it away for free and walk away with your hands clean. This pairs with the 9/11 angle- backdoors and security creating a web that makes it impossible to tell who knows what or what interest is actually in control, the addition of private contractors turning the intelligence apparatus into something truly impossible to get your arms around. The only victory is to uncover one piece of the puzzle.\nThe ending feels in line with those of these other late career dalliances, small personal victories with a twisted sense of hope- the children frolicking into an online and real life wilderness, with no way to monitor or ensure their safety, only the trust that you’ve prepared them for what the world has to offer and maybe done enough to make the world a safer place. \nPynchon in NYC is also just fun as a fan, tackling more domestic characters (parents? with partners? and responsibilities?) and new subcultures, one more contemporary to our world.

I was fully in for about half of it- you start elaborating on birds, the origins of wage labor, quoting Southland Tales, I Think you Should Leave and Georges Perec and you got me nailed down to a T- but it feels like she didn’t quite stick the landing all the way (even if I liked the ending). Perhaps there’s no way to satisfying get to the bottom of time and our relationship to it, but it felt worse than that- it feels like she got lost in her own disparate connections, somewhat lost sight of the old goal. Perhaps the simple thesis of How To Do Nothing helped make all the navigating feel more guided. In some ways, this feels like the opposite of something I noted about Animal Vegetable Miracle, which was unapologetically a time capsule of some of the haughtiness of Bush-era liberalism- this one approaches some of its points timidly, seeking out possible criticisms before they can land, trying to cover every possible interest group before they can object to the book and losing the ability to make actual arguments and substance because of it.<br/><br/>That being said, I think this book has a lot to actually say, just as her last book did. The history of Taylorism and selling your time- the origins of wage labor and contemporary obsessions with workplace efficiencies, the subject of capital trying to account for the productivity of every moment (whether imposed by actual all-seeing systems or just an imagined panopticon). Her resistance to the idea of history as the result of inevitable forces, the engagement with the present as where change can occur, negating the bound to have happened past and the bound to happen future (even if I found some of her scholarship and reference work lacking that could’ve helped her build it out). The disconnection from the seasons (easy to say as a Bay Area writer) that leads to all time feeling the same. In the end, what she proposes is a sort of anti-productivity, or perhaps better worded an anti-efficiency; she’s not against work, but she is against the obsession with efficiency, with making sure every second reaches the maximum amount of efficiency. Instead, she searches to linger in moments, to watch the passing of the seasons, to make time for the differently abled and for work to be done in its own time rather than as quickly as possible. It’s a utopian vision, and not one I always feel like she does the best job showcasing here, but it’s a nice one to visit nonetheless.","day_read": "2025/12/01"},"the_loser": {"title": "The Loser", "author": "Thomas Bernhard", "stars": "4", "review": "Very compelling as a one paragraph, stream of consciousness telling (almost entirely in the past) of getting crushed by being in proximity to genius. There’s not a whole lot of plot or action besides, but Bernhard’s delve into the mind provides all the juice- all self-contradicting, elliptical, repeating, bitter movements of a mind looking back at its own life and those closest to it (and of course, there’s plenty here that can be interpreted as being truly 3 sides to the same coin; the shared lung diseases that Bernhard also had being the most obvious one). All self-justifying machinations in service of dodging that he in part drove his friend to suicide, that he wanted to gawk at his failure and demise, that he needed a loser to point at for his own construction of self. The invented Glenn Gould is pure artistic genius, a man who would chop a tree down with an axe if it meant it would make his piano sound better, who would applaud a Nazi statue if it made his work sound better, solely dedicated to his craft, a pure ideal. The narrator and his friend are lost before the ideal, all too human with their neuroses, cut down upon hearing his playing, burning any non musical artistic creations they muster; they can only escape, through solitude in the narrator’s case, or through possessing their sister until she leaves and suicide is the only answer, a final artistic act. In the end, all that’s left of the three will be Gould, the Goldberg Variations that knocked them down in their youth.

Hicks’ uncle admire Hitler from afar in Milwaukee and hangs with his boys at a pro-Nazi bowling alley where nobody really bowls, and fascist gangs are roving the countryside. A woman runs towards her fate as an anarchist saint in Spain, golems retrieve mistakenly identified as Jews from camps of fascists (Harley Davidson has to be a Jewish bike because Davidson, you see), and clarinetists scour the European countryside for safe places to shuttle Jews if it comes to it. In case you thought he meant this was a European problem, he throws in a half page dalliance at the end to bring you back to the States, towards our homegrown fascism. Pynchon takes a moment, also towards the end, to do a little aside, to look at the reader and bring you to your own present moment, to what you are doing: he asks, quite literally, will you bury your head in the sand, start a family, buy a house, keep your head down, ignoring what goes on around you, until the regret swallows you? And then he says no one is around to hear it anymore. It is a stunning bit of audience work, after he spends much of his time in Hungary/Europe doing his usual deluge of characters and setpieces, to bring it back to something direct and digestible and in such a gut punching way.  <br/><br/>I also found the ending pretty stunning, as perhaps the final piece of writing (although hopefully not!) he puts out. In a letter from a teen informant of Hicks, he shows perhaps a glimmer of hope, or something similar- the youth in revival, in search of something golden at the end of the rainbow in California, where so many Pynchon books land, the innocence and hope always in spring somewhere even if you’re laden with the responsibility of having to fight, too world weary to go looking for it, or too old to do anything but look back on the past. “Maybe they’ll keep finding new ways to be innocent,” chasing sunsets in California, the dream lives on. If this is the end, then it’s about as good as a way to go out, but maybe we’ll see one more sunset and we can turn to Tommy P for advice (or at least a laugh) one last time.","day_read": "2025/11/21"},"the_greening": {"title": "The Greening of America, 25th Anniversary Edition", "author": "Charles A.

In my Nixon induced madness I picked this one up because Nixonland mentioned it a few times and I wanted a more at the time look and analysis at the youth movement of the age (plus it was on my girlfriend’s shelf and I was bookless at the time). I knew it would be wrong in many ways, but how wrong it was was somewhat shocking. <br/><br/>It’s easy to look at some analyses of the political situation and say “what no material analysis does to a mf,” and usually that’s directed at people that genuinely don’t know better. Reich knows better! He points at material analysis, hand waves it away, and then substitutes his consciousness based analysis which, while sociologically interesting, does not have a theory of change beyond “if enough people believe things it will change things” which he knows (and cites as part of his project) doesn’t work because Vietnam is happening as he writes. It feels like blind optimism, perhaps fear of what would have to happen (or attempt to happen) if systemic change were really to occur.<br/><br/>Part of a seemingly broad project of the 1960 and 1970s to realize that man himself needed to change in order to inaugurate a more just society- Lefebvre I think very smartly refrains from speculating too much, but this book launches into a full reveries about how the hippie consciousness is the wave of the revolution. I think his analysis of the culture is interesting, and to be honest in some cases feels like an aspirational consciousness that people on Instagram are trying to emulate. Of course, as the Instagramness implies, this consciousness is easily wielded by capital to market and funnel into the world that capital provides. If there was a revolutionary aspect to it, it was only as a self-interest, to try to avoid Vietnam service (or to get coed dormitories). The analysis of the more conservative, competitive consciousness is relatively rote, but I also found the analysis of the liberal meritocrat interesting, particularly in its assertion that they try to “dominate” their hobbies, or have control over them, rather than allow themselves to be open to surprise or vulnerability, and that they never let their passions eclipse their need to fit as a useful tool of society (he’s really obsessed with surfing and skiing for this one). <br/><br/>Felt like the people that watch Fight Club and Office Space and complain about “people in the 90s bitching about their soulless office jobs” but for a powerful administrative state that somewhat tried to bend business and society to the wills of the common good.

Perlstein mentions him getting access to the archive of cable TV for this book, and in many ways you can feel it- the cutting between the various news items of the day- in many instances the writing calls to and tries to evoke the feeling of the news- the news that incited many to follow Nixon and not just vote for him but idolize him. It is a torrent of information that can be overwhelming but very successfully mimes the tumultuous tenor of the age. <br/><br/>Nixon is such a definable character, so obvious in his flaws and foibles and also his assets. Maybe my favorite anecdote of the book is him spilling soup on himself at a White House dinner and then banning soup from being served at the White House again, because it wasn’t manly (soup heads in shambles). There’s countless cases where Nixon is on the outs, where it seems his career is over- both from people in his own party and from people outside it. But he was tenacious and he was power thirsty and he did have a sense of the prides and resentments of Americans, of the darkness inside them, and he was able to weaponize them in his favor. Some of the political maneuvering in here is awesome in its cynicism and guile- him sending fliers with inaccurate information on events for the candidate he didn’t want to face, all of the ratfucking of the DNC field in 72 really, and him constantly sabotaging Vietnam peace talks in order to win elections. His ability to turn a losing conflict in Vietnam into a winning political issue with voters in 72 against McGovern, who was consistently on the right side of it, is one of the most impressive feats of politicking one can imagine (and also the ultimate condemnation of American elections and the role of public relations politics). The legacy of the POW/MIA bit of PR is still present today in modern conflicts- think of Benghazi, think of Biden’s ultimate demise really coming after the pulling out of Afghanistan. <br/><br/>Perlstein argues quite successfully that Nixon defined the terms of American politics for decades and even to this day. The first cracks in American economic excellence, the first contractions of who was given access to American dream, the first raises denied- all lead to the formation of a politics that we still not have escaped. The liberals as the snobs, the elites who looked down at the little guy, or the idealist hippies with no respect for the hard work of the common man, as cowards too scared to attain military victory if they would just keep going. The conservatives as the silent majority, those too busy working hard to complain, defenders of American excellence and private property from roving hordes of immigrants, of minorities, of degenerates looking to corrupt your children.

There’s obligatory sections about cordyceps and psilocybin that don’t necessarily cover fresh ground for anybody but have to be in a book about mushrooms, but the real joy of the book is the other stuff. His description of the symbiotic relationships are different than many other conceptions of the naturla hierarchies, albeit he often lays it on a little thick with the way he emphasizes them. Found the lichen (particularly lichen in space) and the gardening soil possibilities the most interesting, along with the medicinal and waste absorption portions, as well the descriptions of how mycelium and hyphae function. Clearly points you towards alternate definitions of intelligence in ways I’ve only really seen done in science fiction (shout out Blindsight). <br/><br/>This book is clearly meant to drive interest towards mushrooms in part because of how underdeveloped the field is, to the point of it almost seeming like a shining advertisement trying to find a rich guy to throw money at mycologists. It’s amazing how late in the game scientifically speaking many of the discoveries featured here are relative to how we know the timelines of discovery for plants and animals, so I can’t find fault in it for doing so, but I also don’t need to know of every way someone is using mushrooms to make money. <br/><br/>I guess I can forgive the mushroom compost for destroying my first gardening adventure.

It is a beautiful thing to realize, though, that people over 120 years ago had to listen some of the same inane ramblings that I have, that I’m sure many of you have. <br/><br/>The second third’s perspective change is at least slightly more interesting, as there’s more going on with Lou’s perspective than “annoying cokehead,” but at the end of the day I just don’t need that much fiending for coke and heroin portrayed for me. <br/><br/>The third part is at last the most interesting part, as we get to Crowley’s alternate community of Thelema, an interesting precursor to the alternate living experiments that became much more prevalent post 1960s. The points are much the same- that modern society does not funnel human beings into what is existentially fruitful for the human, but for what is economically productive for the society. This book’s conception of drug use is that this dissonance is where the drug addiction comes from- that when day to day life is not in accordance with man’s natural desires, he will become addicted to the chemically induced one that is more in alignment with it, with no will to return to the old life because it not good for him. The capital W Will, what man is truly uniquely shaped for, is the way to handle drugs, the way they can be used for his betterment. The castle community is designed to provide a space free from economic constraints for people to do that.<br/><br/>It all sounds well and good. But then the main character discovers his only purpose in life is designing a helicopter and his wife’s one and only purpose in life is to support and help him accomplish his Will and then you start to squint your eyes a little bit.

Are big business and marketing an equal level of manipulator and interest group as people that don’t want giant billboards enshrouding their neighborhood with corporate drivel? If you believe this book’s final arguments, the answer might not be what you think! <br/><br/>I found this to be insightful when it was analyzing the logic and symbolism of sprawl; understanding what the signifiers are and what is being signified by the sprawl and the strip is important, and there’s plenty of insights/ways of seeing the world that I will use. These include the concept of duck vs. decorated shed, the building that’s form is the advertisement for the building itself (the example being the duck building in New Jersey for a duck farm) against a more traditional shaped building with signage or signifiers on it that indicates what it is; the idea that the parking lot is the true advertisement of what a supermarket has to provide to the consumer; the difficulty of mapping the modern world with its array of lights and scale; a general re-emphasis on utilizing ornaments/known symbolism rather than “pure” architecture, form for the sake of from; and its overall love of signs in general (down to saying one casino had been subsumed by and become its sign). However, just because it is important to understand to them, does not mean they should be held up as peak architecture, or the ideal response to the modern age; and just because they are an ideal fit for a technological age does not mean they are good, generally. Should we design our buildings solely so they communicate and are understood by the speeding automobile? Perhaps in our gas station stops and our highways, but to say that the Las Vegas Strip is well-designed for that purpose and should be an example to others is to glorify the hideous, awful nature of the world, and give up any hope of designing a better one.  The suburban tchotchke out front of the cookie cutter home is not an ideal but a cry for help, a last gasp of individuality in a sea of stifling architectural sameness. The Silent Majority’s world was clearly not one to be venerated, and neither, perhaps, is the one proposed or pointed to by the modernist architects. Maybe I’m irrevocably ruined by reading Nixonland, but perhaps this is best read as an elite institution being shocked by the state of the common electorate and their election of Nixon and using that to wildly and erratically attempt to course correct towards “common” values, similar to how the liberal elite responded to Trump’s first election (never forget Hillbilly Elegy).","day_read": "2025/09/17"},"the_department": {"title": "The Department of Speculation", "author": "Jenny Offill", "stars": "3", "review": "Unfortunately do not see the hype with this one- think I might be allergic to to this type of writing, the one that quotes and references all the hip thinkers of the 20th century intertwined with domestic dramas and issues.

Turns out naval shenanigans and colonialism can be kind of a fun read- big shoutout to Crowley, who manages to keep this compelling for most of its runtime by writing really good breakdowns of the battle strategies and the larger tactical decisions at hand while also keeping an eye for period oddities and general quirks of the past. He’s able to encapsulate that in part by keeping his scope incredibly narrow- the forays to the European continent are very rare- the eye of the book is almost always on the Indian Ocean and what’s happening there. I could see this as being frustrating to some, but for me (a 15th century idiot) it was actually useful to keep it limited and reserve the context for Wikipedia deep dives after the fact. <br/><br/>Some of my favorite historical quirks: the Portuguese thinking they had rounded Africa when they reached its curve; thinking they could cross the continent via rivers and getting trapped; the belief in an African Christian king Prester John with gold tipped weaponry that would enable them to team up and take down the Muslims for good; the encounters with Hindus where they assume them to be slightly misguided Christians; the Portuguese winning a battle with 90 people because they were the first to understand how tides work and could be everywhere their enemy was as they tried to make their way to their stronghold; the Portuguese official sent to India who immediately trying to make a stab at glory gets himself killed in a quest for more booty, following in a line of powerful nobles dying in fights they could’ve easily won in the hopes of glory; the sailors building secret compartments in ships to have sex with the beautiful women under the guard of a eunuch. <br/><br/>Crowley can descend into a little history teacher voice, glossing over some of the atrocities in order to pump up the accomplishments, especially in the final chapter summarizing the aftermath and all that was accomplished. It’s a difficult tightrope to walk toeing that line, and it’s possible I’m overly sensitive to it- the majority of the actual book does a good job staying neutral, letting the reader make many of their own judgements. The Chinese fleet mentioned in the opening contextualize everything that follows- a similar voyage, with similar power, handled entirely different between the cultures- the Portuguese always looking for an edge, always looking to grab the blade. <br/><br/>Reminded me, perhaps strangely, perhaps not, of some of the stuff I saw in the Jakarta Method- of groups assuming the good faith of their opponents (or at least visitors), assuming them not to just be out for blood and power, which is then used to subjugate them until violent resistance is impossible, utilizing pre-existing prejudices to fan the flames in their favor.

Often the desire for Carol feels totally beyond the narrator’s ability to articulate, even as it is all-consuming and taking priority over her world. Love features as an escape for both of them, a road to self-definition- Carol dealing with the loss of her marriage, motherhood being taken from her, Therese dealing with a stultifying retail job, a boring relationship, and facing the realities of the real world. There’s plenty of psychoanalysis to be had here in regards to the relationship dynamic- Therese seeking to find a mother to replace the one that neglected (even as the relationship splinters re-enacting her being second to her half sister in childhood), Carol looking for a daughter to replace the one she’s losing in the divorce- but the book itself turns the tables in its final acts, almost a coming of age, as Therese finds empowerment without Carol (and Carol rediscovers her own life) that allows her to return to the table as equals, to see her partner not as the idealized figure she had built but a real, complicated person. <br/><br/>The thriller moments are the weakest here in my view- probably put together to somewhat get around the taboo of its existence (and also to materialize the societal discrimination around it).

There’s tons of in practice interpretations on dreams of both his patients and himself, along with developments of all sorts of concepts regarding dreams (that all previous theories he established fall into, save that dreams are totally meaningless) and ultimately coming up with an entire theory of the mind. It took me a few months to get through this and I’d be lying if I said I remembered all (or most of it). <br/><br/>First off, the good stuff- the dreams. Every dream is a wish fulfillment, says Freud, no matter how insignificant or small the dream may seem, no matter how grim or nightmarish its contents. The dreams consist of the manifest content, what is actually dreamed, and the latent content, which is what the unconscious is acting out, the fulfillment driving the manifest content. The manifest content is most often material from life in the last day (or two or three), but can also can include material that the dreamer’s conscious mind can’t recall itself. Here is where many of the more crank theories of Freud originate, from the idea that any anxiety dream is driven by a libidinal urge to the Oedipal complex (which is less sexual here than commonly presented, but more as a rivalry for the affection of the mother with the father than a desire for sex). Some of the highlights of the dreams are Freud interpreting a women putting books in a box as about sex because, well, box, c’mon, Freud not interpreting his dream of riding a horse between two pillars as being sexual in any way, and Freud’s guilt dream for accidentally killing his friend by prescribing him more cocaine for a condition that was caused by cocaine. One of the more instructive dreams, however, is one where a child close to the dreamer dies, but there is no emotion attached to it- Freud unravels that the last time she had seen a lost lover was at the funeral for another child that had died, and that the funeral was actually a disguised wish fulfillment to see her beloved again. <br/><br/>This also sees the initial development of Freud’s theory of the mind, the unconscious, the filtering mechanism, and the conscious that he would obviously go on to make much more expansive. Also appearing is the concept of transference- the idea of the unconscious applying greater significance upon something that the conscious has in view in that is not significant in order to make some disguised wish apparent.<br/><br/>In the end, I think he does make a compelling case that the unconscious is involved in the dream process, that there is latent content to what our mind cooks at night, that dreams are a way to outlet the repressed and unsatisfied wishes of the mind. While some of his specifics go askew, I think this represents a useful (although not true) method of interpreting dreams and of the mind. Some of those limitations become apparent as you look into Freud’s mind itself throughout- his mind is very language driven, rather than image driven- there’s very little in the form of visual symbolism here, but plenty in terms of word connections, puns and other language play. That constrains some of his work and its usefulness, but also makes it an interesting view into the mind of such an influential figure beyond just the ideas in the text. <br/><br/>I might need a break from psychoanalysis but I will return- this was interesting and I think useful, at least to let me interpret all of my friend’s dreams and their minds.","day_read": "2025/07/25"},"free_day": {"title": "Free Day", "author": "Inès Cagnati", "stars": "4", "review": "This one grew on me as I read it- first as I grew to appreciate the voice of the young narrator, the self-assured, matter of fact, constantly self contradicting cynicism built out of the combo of youth and hard living that I think Cagnati nails note for note, and then the odd sense of dread it builds that in the moment isn’t clear whether it stems from the harsh circumstances of her life or something worse until the final chapters take place. The dread is really well accomplished- just out of place details, an accumulation of things slightly off noted by the character but not put together (or at least not acknowledged) until she’s told in a flashbulb moment.<br/><br/>The final symbol of the book- the bicycle sliding away into the icy river, just as her dreams of school, of buying better land do the same- is one that’s stuck with me, that I think stands out even in its simplicity. Part of that is the way the love of the bike is built up, the sturdy, reliable companion of the narrator, her source of independence and joy- her love of it is built up constantly.<br/><br/>Very impressed with just how well this is executed and pulled off, much of that coming from the prose which works so well on the levels of bringing out character where there is very little dialogue and setting down those signposts of dread.","day_read": "2025/08/08"},"civilwarland_in": {"title": "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline", "author": "George Saunders", "stars": "5", "review": "A weird combination of Carver type characters in quiet states of desperation but replaces the dreary everyday Americana with futuristic theme parks. The tone can be harshly bleak and comedic, sometimes in the same sentence. It loves it little sci-fi details but also loves a well-sketched character trudging through life. It’s an interesting mix, but it’s one that I think works- often because the jobs/businesses he creates are where idealism meets the cold, hard reality of the world on one end or the other. <br/><br/>If there’s a theme I see throughout, it’s often about labor and agency, about the situations work often puts us into of ethical quandary and how we respond, often giving a piece of ourselves to keep the lights on and the bills paid. There is no reword for being the yes man; just the boss telling you he hated you for it as the company goes under. The water park won’t fire you for killing a kid with the wave pool, but you have to live with his ghost haunting you and your wife fucking your boss that you hate cause he’s cooler than you. You take the memories from the old lady until she only has the precious ones she can’t part with, then you take your own because you have nothing to life for yourself. The theme park dehumanizes you and possibly leaves you at the hands of hateful customers, but what else is out there in a world where you can be enslaved.<br/><br/>The highs are incredibly high- some of my favorite short stories I’ve ever read live in here.

Feels contemporary in a lot of ways, the constant profanity and general comedie/ironic/self deprecating tone, the way it talks about sex and dating, or maybe it’s an eternal truth of men finding it hard to commit, loathing themselves for that lack of commitment, and loathing women for their lack of commitment.<br/><br/>Also is just funny and lively as a piece of writing, constantly crackling with energy and vulgarity that never wears out its welcome, manages to feel fresh consistently even as it hits a lot of the same beats, delving into them deeper or hitting them from fresh angles. <br/><br/>All-time punchline of an ending, and has maybe the most extended piece of work I’ve read about masturbation that stays funny the whole time.

Guilt and paranoia are everywhere, a country full of war criminals experiencing comeuppance and looking behind their backs constantly for the punishment to land directly upon their head, the American occupiers and sheer poverty already surrounding the day to day. There’s some excess here in terms of the noir darkness, but that has more to do with character and monologue than it does in sheer atmosphere. There’s some scenes here that will stick with me: the prostitution hotel set up for Americans, the first person POV of being killed, the rotting of humans on trains, of food on the streets, the bloated, disgusting corpse from the book’s opening chapter. <br/><br/>Peace’s style perhaps contributes to that excess, constant line breaks and repetitions and normal font/italicized font bouncing off each other constantly.

Radicals hoped to change the world by creating their own slice of heaven, by creating their own world through their community isolated from broader society. Reformers instead sought to change the world through the changing of laws; this is as broad as abolitionists to prohibitionists to woman suffragettes. Seldes’ tends to see the radicals as beatific saints, even in their failures, beautiful and shining in their purity of thought and action even as they failed time after time. The reformers he tends to see more as imposers, seeking to force their will upon society through force of law. <br/><br/>Speaking of the will, if there’s a central idea to this book that he traces, it’s that of the will. His framing for the whole book is Jonathan Edwards, certainly a crank but not an eccentric- but through Edwards inventing the idea of the will, namely God’s will, that man could be saved only through God’s smiling upon him or not and through no good deed or faith could man be saved, this opened the can of worms for all sorts of heresy and crankery. For if God could have the will to save man, couldn’t man have the will to save himself? The tracing of the idea is a little sketchy; he tends to avoid it for chapters at a time and then return it, so obsessed with historical cataloging he is; but it’s a compelling one that I struggled to follow at times his logic. <br/><br/>All sorts of funny details in here due to the time period, both from the cranks themselves to Seldes writing. At one point, he tries to reference the pull out method because a cult “invented it”; however he says he cannot because he’ll get sued for it (a real concern at the time of his writing). Seldes’ description of the revival meetings and the seizing takes a tack that makes it all seem understandable, by starting with the conditions of the American frontier; lonely, isolated, hard living, with seeing people outside of your immediate family rare, when all of a sudden tents roll into town and you’re surrounded by a crowd, all set to an emotional fever pitch. There’s the cults started mainly so a leader could have sex with his friend’s wife, the cults that banned sex and thus died off gracefully from old age despite economic prosperity and community cohesion, the cults that believed man could achieve perfection on Earth and to prove it would lay naked with a beautiful woman (to predictable results and scandal). And then there’s of course, the ultimate legend, the prohibitionist Carry A Nation, who would go to bars and (ineffectively) sing 12 verses of a song to try to get the drinkers to stop, started throwing rocks at bars when that didn’t work, started bringing a hatchet for when she ran out out of rocks, who once drove a young unwed couple to suicide after catching them having sex (and was proud of having done so).<br/><br/>This book is pretty long, and Seldes’ can get caught up in minutia. I think it’s probably best as a pick up once every two weeks or so book rather than a read continuously one. But it’s all fascinating, and he does a good job of diving into detail and not coming to too many conclusions- he mostly ends up shrugging his shoulders and saying he’s just as confused at the modern and ancient condition as any. This includes the ending, which starts with him exalting and claiming to aim at a normal life, then pointing the finger at scientists, Roman Catholics, and classicists as salvation hunters in the line of the cranks in the book, then quotes Proust saying that all great works of art, all religions, all human achievements comes from the neurotic, obsessed, eccentric, and then, as a final shrug of the shoulders, just says “And yet-” as if to point at the shenanigans that the previous 400 pages consisted of as evidence enough that eccentricity is a dark path.

I don’t think this is the finest example of his work, mostly cause I’m not sure a dumb guy concept (said flatteringly) such as this benefits as much from Mieville’s touch as the other concepts/ideas he’s tackled. He tends to work by increasingly escalating and complicating the sci-fi concepts at the same times as he does the plot machinations but there’s just slightly less fertile ground for him to dig into here in the confines of this Keanu comic book franchise than there is when he’s off on his own. He’s mostly probing at territory similar to Martin Hagglund’s This Life: that death is what gives our lives meaning and shape, that without a time ticking clock there cannot be meaning, although in a way the ending finds meaning in the endless procession of lives the Keanu character has. The real enemy, then is stillness, is the loss of the cycle, a perpetual cycleless stasis, and life’s quest to overcome death feeding into that possibility of stasis.<br/><br/>There’s a lot of cool imagery in here and well-developed sci-fi concepts, which makes the ending being lightning bolts shooting a tad disappointing/muddled but the road up to there makes the sci-fi elements interesting and compelling to both ideas and imagery. <br/><br/>In the end, this finds a middle ground between Conan style Keanuism and Mieville cerebral sci-fi that works somewhat but ultimately doesn’t tickle the itch as hard as I would’ve liked in either direction.

The tone of this at times is so smarmy and self-satisfied that I can get why people could hate it (and I could see how she wrote something as bad as Demon Copperhead). I don’t think she intends to come across as shaming but the amount of holier than thou lines she throws around about normal American eating habits is truly uncountable ('the only American food export worth mentioning starts with a McD”). She rants about vegans being naive and basically calls them stupid. Maybe once is a possible policy change actually mentioned; instead it’s blaming consumer choices all the way down. Maybe once does she mention the privilege of working a job that doesn’t require her to leave the home, of owning a farm. In some ways, this does it a service; it keeps it on message, which is the benefits and the how of eating local, and lord knows there’s been too many hand wringing books and thinkpieces in the last post-Trump era that spend more time apologizing than they do making their points. But still, reading it in the modern age was a tad shocking, a register we don’t really see out in the wild anymore.<br/><br/>With all those criticisms out of the way, I loved this book! The facts about big agriculture and lack of diversity in grocery store produce were all interesting, albeit stuff I’d heard in bits and pieces from other places. But Kingsolver has a gift for communicating what brings her joy, for describing the satisfaction in preparing a home cooked meal from scratch, of what food can do to bring people together, of the rewarding nature of growing something with your own hands and then putting it on your table as a meal, of just the day to day reality and seasonal changes of working to produce your own food for a year. She also communicates well the alienated and unnatural nature of our lives- how disconnected we are from food production, how everything is anonymized and plopped in the grocery store, the concept of a season in food consumption is totally eliminated, how produce from local farms go to rot while the same vegetable is shipped across borders using countless fossil fuels and put in the grocery store. Everything related to food is distanced from its production, its reality, and has in many ways gotten worse since this publication- now DoorDash alienates you from even having to interact with a single person responsible for the preparation of the meal, let alone how the component pieces of it came into being.<br/><br/>It really comes together in the final chapter, an emotional core centered around turkey reproduction.

You will never be this level of hater (and I sure hope you won’t). <br/><br/>Sadly, the haterness starts to grow tiresome past a certain point, and while occasionally a new slant on the hate provides fresh joy for the most part it felt like it dragged a little. The moments where sunlight cracks the blinds of her haterness and she feels sincere emotion are some of the highlights of the book (reminds me somewhat of the moments of sincerity cracking through in Anna Burns’ Milkman).

The writing, at least when it goes to interiority, trends a little sloppy, including an obsession with cutting sentences off midstream (and then mentioning that he cut the sentence off midstream). The novel is told by the narrator who’s supposed to be a bad writer so some of that could hypothetically work but in this case it ended up making this feel a little repetitive and drag. Williams being a playwright aspect really shines when he does set a scene, as swimming in the narrator’s memories of times with his dead ex lover and his childhood in Alabama are the finest aspects of this one, but for every page of that you end up with two or three of poorly done interiority. The most interesting aspect is his encounter with his (unknown to the narrator younger) self: the aging gay writer (being Williams in this case), seeing himself as undesirable, having lost the love of his life, writes his younger self on the verge of closing out his physical prime, with that same loss, abandoned by an even younger lover, looking at his future self with disgust and disdain. That in itself is a very interesting concept, just one that I wished was better developed.

The example of the white protestors stopping a train in a working class neighborhood during rush hour and fighting a black man going to work is the perfect example of this shortsightedness and stupidity- attacking the wrong targets both in economic class and in transportation type.  The overarching point of the book- that the climate movement needs a radical, property damaging, flank, as every successful protest movement before it has had, is one that seems self-evident to serious observers, but he does a good job of building up the case and tearing down the American history book fetishization (and the one XR uses) of the peaceful protestors who changes the world on their lonesome. Malm’s use case of deflating SUV tires is I think a curious parallel (at least in a different context) of the Tesla vandalisms, which drew far more backlash and had more effectiveness than the thousands marching in the streets for the Hands Off protests. Particularly interesting is his history of pipeline sabotage, from anti-Israel actions to those in Africa and South America- in some cases net unsuccessful, in others successful at expelling the oil companies by making the costs greater than the gains. Less compelling is his need to compare this to slavery and other historical injustices; feels like a forced own goal, especially in a movement which he acknowledges himself has a problem with being white. Also found it lacking in looking at radical flanks that failed- thinking of the Weather Underground amongst countless others that followed his principles and ended up losing in the battles of history. As a manifesto and pure polemic I still think it’s effective, which at its length is all it needs to be, but found it lacking in some aspects and laborious in its point making in others, hence the 3.

When the votes are cast, it’s a landslide in the opposite direction, and conservatism is vanquished, surely to slink into the shadows for an eternity, only to be seen in fringe circles and nutjob pamphlets forever. <br/><br/>That is where this story leaves off, the failed Goldwater campaign which despite its failure ultimately transforms America forever from liberal undisputed hegemony to its current state of conservative dominance over both parties. The contradictions of post World War II society are starting to simmer; a middle class, lifted by the post war boom and government policy, begins to resent those looking to climb up onto even terms, especially as they start to look different from them. A civil rights movement emerges that seems unmoved by legislation, demanding real, expensive change that cannot be granted, at least not by one stroke of the pen. An electorate moves rightward in everything but the names it puts down for the presidential ballot box. Barry was just a touch too early, a touch too (I hate to say it) principled to cater to where he needed to, a touch too independent and shoot from the hip to land where he needed to be to be more than a prophet who never got to see the promised land. <br/><br/>It may be grim to see the roots of the shitty political situation we’re in, to see that the root of the conservative movement (at least at the grassroots, voter level; Barry himself is portrayed more sympathetically) is not in some principled ideological conservatism, but in left hating and segregation, in that middle class resentment and backlash to movements for equal rights and desegregation. But also there is in it a glimmer of hope for the future; that political parties can be overturned, that contradictions in the electorate between what they vote for in a politician and what they vote for in policies (see minimum wage increases/Medicare bumps in most states) can be channeled into a movement that actually seizes power and changs the world. <br/><br/>Aside from the overarching details of the political situation, also found this fascinating for all sorts of details of the past. A presidential campaign totally ruined by a candidate getting remarried after a divorce; LBJ running as the peace candidate, claiming no wars are incoming, all the while planning the war in Vietnam the whole time; a write-in candidate winning a primary, then basically cast into irrelevancy immediately after; a man with known Communist affiliations killing the President but it somehow gets blamed on conservative extremism; conservatives taking over Republican organizations by stealing parliamentary procedures from Communists; the emergence of morality as a political concept separating the parties rather than a bipartisan issue. All sorts of interesting characters with connections you wouldn’t imagine too; the founder of Knott’s Berry Farm, major conservative backer with a freedom center on the grounds, the Welch’s grape snacks guy the founder of the John Birch Society. The details of the past are far more interesting and contradictory than the simplistic, propagandized versions sold in high schools and popular conceptions and to go this deep on the not so distant past reveals a lot of that. <br/><br/>There’s been precious little Goldwater in what I’ve written so far, and in a sense, there’s not actually all that much of him in the book (or at least not as much as you would expect). He was reluctant to run from the start, pushed by groups and figures who made his ascendency inevitable behind his back. Those groups made him into a figure far beyond his actual appeal or charisma; crowds would chant his name, treat him like Jesus, and then be bored by his speeches. This was in part because he distrusted anyone outside of his Arizona circle, particularly in the groups that made him into the figure he was, and in part because he thought it was disingenuous to pander (down to the point of giving speeches decrying government programs that gave everyone in his audience benefits). He was, in some ways, one side of the ideal that Republicans pretend to be, a guy who liked flying his plane and cussed on TV and didn’t care for backlash or really anything else.<br/><br/>Perlstein weaves all this history, of major and minor figures, of party reps and fringe groups, in a pretty remarkably compelling fashion. He can get at times bogged down with youth activists and fringe small groups that don’t end up tying all the way back into the main narrative, but very rarely was I bored and most of the time I was fascinated.

A long, French, winding sentence filled, stream of consciousness novel is about as up my alley as it gets, and this met (and exceeded) every expectation.<br/><br/>Incredibly readable, despite its long, flowing sentences and general circling of the same ideas- I found this to be around the comprehensibility of like a Mrs Dalloway. And god, do these sentences rock, hitting every note of metaphor, description, and raw human feeling that feels like one is traveling the throughways of memory and emotion. I think this is my favorite version of this modernist comma filled style yet, which is hard to say as the world’s biggest Virginia Woolf fan. If I stopped to record or highlight every sentence that impressed me, that blew me away, I would never have finished this. So many scenes stand out, digging at those raw feelings and memories of the reader’s own; the cattleyas that lead to Swann and Odette making love for the first time, Swann’s discovery of music’s ability to move him again, the mother’s kiss before bed and all it provokes, the sight of the chrysanthemums leading to the first sight of Swann’s daughter and provoking the feelings in Marcel. And just as well, Proust partially dismantles his own myth-making in an incredible ending- the past is never exactly as we remember it, but shrouded in romanticism and self delusion, a fiction we created for itself. <br/><br/>Can’t think of a book so connected to and devoted to the human emotional experience, of sensory and social delights. It feels impossible for someone living today to write something like this, so in touch with the senses the experience at hand, as inundated and overloaded as our human minds are. There is plenty of propriety and overthinking and societal pressures that keep the characters from their happiness, but all of it is so deeply felt, heartwrenching, that feels hard to get at in today’s emotional landscape. And when Proust leans into societal humor, of buffoons and idiots and sanctimonious pricks, he hits a mark much deeper than simple satire, encompassing of the inner lives of those fools and also of the experience of making friends with them and reconfiguring your inner life so as to make peace with them to impress your girl. All of the chapter Swann in Love is just so, so good, the ups of falling in love, those beginning miracles, those attempts to hide the extent for propriety, the irrationality of it, the change of personality, and the fall, of jealousy and possession, of every denied affection, every moment spent obsessing over what is far away. <br/><br/>Can’t say enough about this book! One of those that makes you want to see the world in a different way, that makes you look back into your own memory and life with renewed appreciation and emotion, that makes you face your day to day experience with a human face rather than some abstracted layer of detachment/boredom.

Very little in the way of character motivation, which adds up to some extent; Beaumont is a man that at the end seems to be driven by little more than some strange obligation, not to a job, not to a man, not to some ideal, but to a task set in front of him that he can’t let go of until it’s done. Despite involving a Senator’s re-election, there’s no politics; everybody’s on the take, everyone is chasing money and power, it’s just a matter of who seizes it. Doesn’t quite hit the highest of highs of the genre but is a fine example of it.

It delivered on both accounts- for the 60s aesthetic, the main character is said to be a misogynist by page 8 or 9, it involves a bit about the French being scared of rolling backpacks, and has some fun time travel paradoxes involving both past and future misaligning in the present, and on the bug men it concludes with a set of telepathic insects who travel the stars, are kind of lazy, and stick food directly into their stomachs rather than inefficiently chewing them.

Very matter of fact in the sense that it does not editorialize, or attempt to make you feel through histrionics or overly flowery writing about the otters themselves- it trusts that in immersing the reader in their lives, giving them a glimpse into their environment and how they live and interact with each other that those sympathies will arise organically. Humans are present only peripherally, as a threat to the otters- the “I” narrator arises maybe 2 or 3 times, and humans are mostly a generator of noise and fear, for the hunt is an ever present danger to the lives of these otters. This distance gives sight into what an unnatural force (particularly because the otters seem to have few other natural threats) humanity is, commanding land and instilling fear into all other creatures, leaving dead animals in their wake for little reason other than their finding satisfaction in cruelty. When humanity isn’t present, this gives a beautiful view of the countryside, the ecosystem and all the herons, cormorants, otters, fish, rodents, and others that make it up, and also of the lives of otters, their mating competitions and rituals, their play, their hunting, their child rearing.

Have heard good things about the author but hadn’t picked up until he nailed the perfect confluence of my interests (and recorded a sweet hypeup video for the Timberwolves playoff run) <br/><br/>This book is about leaving and staying- about watching the planes fly leaving your city with your dad growing up, a city he would never leave and you wouldn’t leave until you were an adult, about Dan Gilbert’s Comic Sans letter, about the player from your neighborhood who was good enough to go to Kansas for college ball, about the hyped up player who was supposed to leave and flame out but never could, about finally getting out and driving 9 hours just so you can go back, about the songs pleading for someone to stay even if you know it’s best for them to stay. It’s about loving and respecting where you’re from, finding and writing the poetry that’s all your own, the court you played on, the block you grew up on, the local legends forgotten elsewhere, the hometown team that is a national laughingstock. Basketball is obviously a character, but this is far more about Ohio, about Columbus, about the parts of the country that the rest mock if they remember it exists and the parts in those states that are the ones even locals sneer at, call dangerous, overpoliced and underfed, the forgotten residents of the forgotten cities in the forgotten state.<br/><br/>The final chapter (the fourth quarter, as he calls it) is one of the most audacious things I read all year- at one point contrasting the iconic LeBron James Game 7 chasedown block with Columbus PD doing plainclothes drive by shootings on unarmed residents. The juxtaposition is stark (and dark) but ultimately effective, at least to me. Basketball is a community, basketball is beautiful, but it is ultimately a salve, the circus because there is no bread, a distraction from day to day life a country that will take your friend’s, your neighbor’s, a child with a toy gun’s life with impunity, that creates and maintains a race of second class citizen that only can achieve glory through athletic achievement and are otherwise demonized.","day_read": "2024/10/21"},"city_of": {"title": "City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles", "author": "Mike  Davis", "stars": "5", "review": "Expansive and unorganized but pretty undeniable as an incredible  history of Los Angeles- the a being important, as this by no means presents a cohesive narrative or a definitive history of LA, but rather a bunch of different histories of the sprawling, expansive city. <br/><br/>Davis’ main interest is in the image and power structures of the city, spending the first chapter detailing the competing visions of the city, from the earliest salesmen pitching a Spanish style oasis to yokel Midwesterners, to the noirs rifling through its seedy underbelly of crime and corruption, to European expats driven insane by the sunshine and the sprawl. A thread throughout is that Los Angeles is not a city built on industry, on manufacturing, but almost always purely on the backs of selling real estate. <br/><br/>The consequence of real estate as industry is evident- explaining the way homeowners fought tooth and nail to “protect” their investments from the “scourge” of apartments and anything to alleviate housing crises or traffic congestion, rejecting train lines and leading to the sprawl we all know and love in Los Angeles. Davis chronicles the rise of the home owner association as a political force, their odd merger with conservation agencies that ultimately score temporary wins over the developers, made politicians cater to their demands, and lead to long-term downstream effects for the whole state (i.e., frozen property taxes, the incorporation of small neighborhoods as separate cities to freeze the downtown out of tax revenue). <br/><br/>Part of the protection of real estate and property values is to keep neighborhoods segregated, to keep white separated from non-white, poor from rich. The dreams of a city where people of different neighborhoods and backgrounds and socioeconomic status all meet meets its end in Los Angeles, particularly in the hostile Downtown, where neighboring Skid Row homeless (or anyone not employed or shopping) are denied water, bathrooms, and subject to police harassment. Architecture is hostile, full of surveillance, uninviting to outsiders; even the libraries look like fortresses. When the factory jobs that had floated the black middle class went off-shore, Davis details how money went to police enforcement (and chronicles the rampant police overreach, pulling over something like 75% of black teenagers in South Central at various points in a campaign of terror, doing drug busts that turn up no drugs for PR for Nancy Reagan, prosecuting and demonizing parents for the drug use and gang affiliations of their children) instead of social programs, how little effort went to education or jobs for the impoverished inner city, and the rise of gangs as neighborhood protection in the stead of any other outlet for the poor. <br/><br/>The Catholic church is also a focus; its primarily poor Latino base, and the ways they are alienated from the centers of power and their goals are sidelined. Maybe the most interesting character of the book is Luis Olivares, a Catholic priest who opens up his pews to house the homeless and fights battles with the city over the unhoused before the Irish Catholic power base shuttles him off. The balance between the Latino rank and file and the richer, whiter money donators rarely goes the way of the common Catholic.<br/><br/>He ends in Fontana, his hometown and perhaps a microcosm of the nature of Los Angeles. First, sold as a dream away from the city, yet close enough to the city for jobs, where one could have chickens and grow vegetables; then, as steel town, where the toxic fumes from the mill killed all the chickens and vegetables; then, after selling the city’s financial future off to developers, as a commuter town for those looking to escape big city life while still working the big city job. It is an encapsulation of the Los Angeles project as a whole; endlessly adaptable, ultimately only hinging on real estate, no promise made to its citizens kept the second there’s a profit to be made out of it.<br/><br/>All of it ends up feeling connected, even if the threads as they’re flying by can feel separated from the pack. Davis’ prose is alive, cutting with cynicism yet also a very real understanding of the material conditions and characters making the decisions along the way. For a lengthy book of history, I found myself never bored, constantly wanting to return to it and talk about it more. Have been reading more and more history of late and this is my favorite one yet.","day_read": "2024/12/05"},"rejection": {"title": "Rejection", "author": "Tony Tulathimutte", "stars": "3", "review": "This book inspired the most hate I’ve ever experienced for something that I ended up sort of liking. There was portions of this that inspired Ready Player One types of vitriol from me; partially, because I knew this author was capable of so much better from the other two stories in the collection. <br/><br/>First, the bad; there’s a middle section of short stories here that I found to be actively bad. One, the Ahegao one, actually starts out reasonably promising, and I think in its early stages has some interesting ideas about brains and sexualitys curdling when only exposed to pornography and the internet and being totally unable to be fulfilled in the real world. Tulathimutte then escalates this to an absurd degree, and then keeps escalating and escalating; usually, this is my favorite kind of bit, but at a certain point the bit ran its way into tedium that lasted for several pages as the shock factor and ideas felt like they had been achieved already but the story kept on running and running. The next story then follows with a white guy tech CEO talking in intentionally bad used Internet/young people slang, which is a bit that can work well in a very small dose but far too long for an long short story. Again, there’s interesting ideas in that, power using youth and slang (poorly) in order to try to cover up their old money machinations to the point of self-delusion on their ownbehavior but again, the bit escalates into tedium rather than further absurdity (for me at least), which is a very bad sign and left me wondering whether I could finish this book. These two were clearly meant to exhaust the reader to some extent, but the purpose they served did not pay off in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now for the good; a decent chunk of these I enjoyed! “The Feminist” I read ages ago in n+1 but has been a modern classic for me for a number of years. Tulathimutte has a rare gift of capturing contemporary self-delusion, as mixed as it is with faux self-awareness, therapy speak, trying to align the personal with some abstract political goal (and using it as a weapon against those who don’t work in your favor), trying to match the real messy reactions of life with some idealized chill reaction to them. His characters are stuck in these fascinating mind mazes as they try to navigate and contort around the world not bending their whims, and watching the mental gymnastics and neuroses play out is wonderful when it’s firing on all cylinders. The second to last full short story, while immensely Twitter brained, is perhaps the most interesting of the bunch, one I think I’ll be turning in my head quite a bit- the nullification of identity, giving into the blob of the Internet, itself a spectacle of fake arguments, fake discourse, fake ideas all colliding, leaving you breathless reading it and totally detached from any sense of material reality. Not sure exactly when it was written, but scrolling through the replies of any post on Twitter at this post will make you feel it more acutely. He of course then plays more sort of annoying meta-fictional games after that, writing a rejection letter to his own novel where he psychoanalyzes himself, because he can’t end on a purely good note. Tulathimutte is a talent, one to follow, but for now he’s maybe a little too enmeshed in the cultures/ideas he’s critiquing to fully escape their reach into his own brain and writing.","day_read": "2024/12/22"},"the_plot": {"title": "The Plot (The Book Series, #1)", "author": "Jean Hanff Korelitz", "stars": "2", "review": "Listened to the last half on audiobook on the way back from Thanksgiving, so feel free to take my opinion with a grain of salt.

Took me almost 3 whole months but it is officially done and dusted (and reviewed almost 9 months later as the year closes- embarrassing!).<br/><br/>The Recognitions is obviously branching and wide in scope, tackling a massive amount of time and parts of the world, topics going from Mithratic sun worship to How To Win Friends and Influence People. Its main character, if there can be said to be one, is an art counterfeiter, a tortured Puritan who can only make excellent fakes in both style and material, miming both the substance of the art style and the long degraded paints. It features one of the most self-loathing self inserts I’ve seen in a long time, an evil man named Recktall Brown, counterfeiters, rubes, and a Puritan preacher who becomes obsessed becomes a Mithriast yet retains his post, spewing his beliefs to a crowd who nods along in compliance even as he strays further and further from their truth. <br/><br/>At its core is a crisis of originality and authenticity, of characters striving for and being crushed by the need to feel as if they are fresh, their own creation, a unique snowflake that stands out to all in the midst of the torrential downpour of humanity (if it sounds like a New York novel, it is). Mommy and daddy issues abound, crying out for recognition (ha!) from an absent figure to validate their meaning and existence. In place of authenticity, as characters grapple with their own emptiness, they turn to fraud, to lies, to gross exaggerations in order to bridge the gap between their own existence and the one they wish for themselves.<br/><br/>Gaddis as a stylist is obviously a highlight for much of it, with my favorite portions of this being any scene of heavy dialogue/the party scenes. The winding nature of conversations, repeated lines to different parties, what amounts to basically meaningless and mindless chatter upon chatter, makes those scenes feel alive and real (and miserable). As with any 900 page novel that is as good as this is, I was crushed by my stupidity, my own bad memory, my inability to understand references (and my own inability to write this in time to actually remember things about it), but also awestruck by the scope and nerve of this thing.

There’s a lot of bloviating in this one, both external and internal, and not all of it feels necessary or intriguing even if it is well-written. That being said, the moments where it does land are some of the best chapters I’ve read this year- the Mister Verloc/Winnie chapter, where Verloc’s monologue of self-regard, paternalistic misogyny, and  laziness boils over to farcical levels and she slowly comes to grips with the monster in front of her and the depths of despair she has been plunged into by her so-called protector simultaneously is really phenomenal. <br/><br/>The stereotypes for left-wing organizations haven’t changed a lot in 100 or so years (and neither has their relative harmlessness).

And the upper class narrator/writer is not merely a one sided source of critique, either; even if Lispector is clearly critical of his methods/intention in telling the story within the story, it’s also clear that by the experience of writing the story of Macabea he is learning something, about himself, about his life, about death. <br/><br/>Filled with all sorts of symbolism and meaning that’s beyond me to some extent- Macabea as a typist, writing out the whims of other people (poorly), while the writer struggles to find or commit to his own words; moments before death, the greatest encounter with life; her inability to vomit, until the climatic moment of joy, car crash, and death all collide- every word feels purposeful yet mysterious, suggestive of abstract meaning and symbolism so characteristic of her work. <br/><br/>Found some of the meta fictional stuff at the beginning a little tiresome on first read but once this gets rolling this fires on all cylinders like few things I’ve read before it.","day_read": "2024/10/26"},"collapse_the": {"title": "Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union", "author": "Vladislav M. Zubok", "stars": "5", "review": "Pretty immaculately laid out history of the fall of the Soviet Union; coming to it from not knowing it a ton about the fall, found it compelling to read through and didn’t present at least too skewed or slanted a viewpoint in one direction or another (although I suspect the USA is painted a tad too innocently in the way they influenced things here). <br/><br/>The man at the heart is Mikhail Gorbachev, who this book gently lays out as a man who really wants to be smart but is actually quite dumb. The project of resurrecting the Soviet economy, of keeping the disparate collection of states together, of opening the Union up and not maintaining the iron fist of the past, was certainly not one that was easy, but at every turn Gorbachev seems to take the step most likely to accelerate the Union’s (and his own) downfall. From banning liquor sales and in so doing tanking the nation’s tax base, to giving the states power that encourages separatist movements and that they use to make operating the Union basically impossible, to making concessions to the West on foreign policy without extracting anything but a set of empty promises, his every move is one in the wrong direction. Reading Lenin will only get you so far if the reader is a dummy, it turns out. The “comedy” of this book is often in Gorbachev’s arrogance, his disbelief that he could be wrong or bamboozled in any way; I don’t have the book anymore (shoutout San Diego Public Library), but perhaps my favorite moment is when Gorbachev gives a quote along the lines of “Gorbachev’s final act has not yet arrived” right before he is unseated permanently and banished to the dust bin of history. <br/><br/>If there’s a perfect foil to Gorbachev, it is Boris Yeltsin, the alcoholic nationalist (who just really wants American love) with no real plans other than unseating the Union and a Russian state all of its own. He is able to grandstand his way to the top because of the weakness of conviction of the existing state, both in ideas (the constant waffling economy, the unclear vision for a federalist or confederacy of states) and in willingness to wield power (the coup that unseats Gorbachev originally allowing him to grand stand in the capital and earn popular support shows the fear to wield force in any way that permeated the state at the time due to the horrors of Stalinism and the 60s). <br/><br/>He hints at an interesting alternate history of the 1990s/21st century; one where Russia takes over China’s place as a manufacturer of consumer goods for the West- this is, of course, where the two countries diverge, Russia going with the Chilean/University of Chicago method of “shocking” the economy by jumping straight to the free market, China doing an easing that protected both its citizens and the production of the country. When the USA went looking, Russia was too much in disarray, its economy in shambles, unable to produce even if asked; meanwhile, China was ready, and in doing so became a world superpower. If the Union had stayed together, it’s hard to say what would have happened; but this book at least points to what led to its collapse, and what current conflicts stemmed from this moment (crazy to see every single origin of the Russian-Ukrainian war coming from agreements made at the collapse, mostly because Yeltsin was just in a hurry to seize power and take over the Union), as well as what disasters were averted in the process (nukes running amok). The USSR’s eagerness to join wit the West is another fascinating divergence in history, one that can only lead to speculation and alternate histories, one of countless ones this book lays out.","day_read": "2024/08/15"},"they_a": {"title": "They: A Sequence of Unease", "author": "Kay Dick", "stars": "4", "review": "Doesn’t go for more direct, applicable metaphors, which is why it’s probably largely forgotten, but also why I think it’s much better than something like Fahrenheit 451.

I think the strongest, most realized parts are inside the familial unit, particularly of the main character Nomi and her father after they’ve been left by both her sister and her mother. This dynamic, of daughter bound by obligation to not leaving him alone to live in a place she hates, scared of what a life that she doesn’t hate could look like, and of defeated father, too committed to his faith to ever leave the church or the town, too broken and withdrawn to try to find a way to fully engage with his daughter, felt realized to me. The relationship between her and her boyfriend is a tad cliche, all frolicking in fields and rolling through hills with puppy love, but the moments of teenage awkwardness and inability to communicate make it feel slightly more realized than a few well-worn images, and it fits some of what it’s going for- without religion, she only knows to look for an idealized image- as represented by her repeated vision of hanging out with Lou Reed in New York. <br/><br/>My issue with it is how the town feels- for a town that is defined both internally and externally by the conservative, over the top religion, it doesn’t actually feel all that religious? There are mentions, to be sure- husbands can’t sit with their excommunicated wives, the school has restrictive dress codes, etc., but Nomi basically goes on months long bender and there is little backlash from the community leading up to her eventual excommunication. There appears to be a thriving party scene, sexual promiscuity, cool haircuts- all things that could certainly exist, for sure, but also ones that would drive much more widespread judgement and notice from the community (at least in my experience/view). There’s definitely an aspect of the town, so rundown and hopeless, that isn’t actively practicing their faith the way they present, but in my experience that makes the judgement stronger.<br/><br/>That said, there’s parts of this that really resonated. The ending of Nomi leaving behind the church felt very real- so free, yet so ill equipped to deal with it, the terrifying notion of starting your life and your mind anew, your previous rebellion just a lashing out and way of observing the religion in its own way. The narration is pretty funny and I liked her as a character generally, even if parts of this lulled for me/didn't fully connect.","day_read": "2024/11/05"},"city_of": {"title": "City of Saints and Madmen (Ambergris, #1)", "author": "Jeff Vandermeer", "stars": "4", "review": "After being thrown head first (because I read the third book of the trilogy first) into the world of Ambergris and really loving it, I figured I’d go back to the start, and, man, it turns out there’s a reason they ordered the books the way they did. This one is more than just world building, the book, but if I were to describe it to someone it would be as a vibe collage of a crazy science fiction city/world (which the third book does not really slow down much to explain; to be clear, I loved that too).<br/><br/>There’s aspects that I didn’t love of this; perhaps I was ready to move on by the time it arose, but the meta in text “Jeff Vandermeer” element didn’t do a lot for me (although I don’t think it was without value, and could see a reread bearing dividends). But basically everything else hit for me; I loved the mixed text style, from histories to tracts to in universe fiction, all of it coalescing into a vision of Ambergris that feels like the version in your head that you get from reading about a place and never actually visiting; flitting vibes, contradictory ideas, wisps of an image forming in your head that reality simultaneously could never live up to but also could not be captured by. It is rare I think to see a world this fully realized by an author who also understands that the world building has to be in service of something other than cool theoretical world on the page, and Vandermeer really excels here at that, with stylistic flourishes and ideas all over the page.

Throw some COINTELPRO and CIA tampering in there, and you have an all-time combination of Mike-core elements here, but beyond the elements sounding intriguing it’s really quite impressive how well thought out and constructed this world feels. <br/><br/>The main character is an amalgamation of detective tropes, hard drinking, sad about his ex wife, having a more reliable muscle for a partner, depressed about the world, bad at his job now but god he used to be the best…we all know the type at this point. I didn’t find a ton about him compelling, but the side characters are the squeeze here- our murder victim, the lost messiah, is I think the real best portion of it, and much of the action is chasing his shadow. <br/><br/>Reads definitely like a literary author taking on the detective genre (positive), all grimness and grime dressed up in plenty of literary flourishes. Perhaps the closest it comes to The City and The City in the way it builds a world around the keepings of the detective novel and style that I’ve read to date, which is about as high a praise as it comes from me. <br/><br/>“These are strange times to be a Jew,” is the oft-repeated line of the book, and maybe what is revolves around- an alternate homeland, one at the very least less politically sensitive and defined by outside threats than the current one, still sits on the precipice of dissolving, flinging a once-united Jewish people all across the globe, as far as Madagascar. Chabon is a critic of the existing state of Israel, but he also lays out a literal chess board in this novel where there is no good move left to play, which applies to plenty of the characters but also the nation itself; no way to build a homeland without displacing someone else; no way to come onto the global stage at that time without being at the mercy of powers beyond your own.

Didn’t get too much out of it other than the laughs, the style is pretty to the point, but still a great time.","day_read": "2024/10/01"},"simple_passion": {"title": "Simple Passion", "author": "Annie Ernaux", "stars": "4", "review": "An interesting little 60 pages (and of course, very French)- 60 pages of a married man having an affair with the author, with precious little of the actual man (or of the actual woman)- she even calls it a book not about him, nor about her, but about the feeling itself, an all-consuming passion that overrides all else, a longing in their separation that replaces all other passions. An interesting little project, to make about book about loving the other with precious little of the other or of the self in it- love almost as an all-consuming, destructive force, not controllable by the party afflicted by its sting.

But the tangles are always what make it, the details, and this one has it in spades; the incredible dialogue (how many pet names does our main character have for his wife), building out a very distinct character, so charming and full of bluster that you start rooting for him even as he moves into bad moral waters. The ambiguity of the telling, leaving out character plans and motivations, as if the impact of his actions and his own plans are a mystery to himself until the very last, guided by a hand outside himself on a purely unconscious, fate plane. His end is not announced, but felt, making even as its obvious the direction this is heading the reader still thinks it can’t be, wishes against it.

A book I found totally infuriating and also pretty captivating at times- Eugenides can write, for sure, and plenty of this I found stirring on both a prose level and on character setup/narrative progression/historical narrative level. The voice of Cal is super compelling and entertaining to read, and it got me through this book despite some of the ways it made me want to put it down. <br/><br/>Now the ways it made me cringe. I’m all for historical fiction, something that teaches you about history as it traverses its narrative- I’d say most of the things I like are doing some version of that. However, this one has some of the most eyerolling instances of shoehorning history with narrative I’ve ever seen- the reveal of Zizmo has the founder of the Nation of Islam made me put the book down wholesale with how just generally lazy and inconsiderate of the history it was working with was. Everything in Detroit can’t just happen around them, but has to be deeply rooted in the characters already placed in the story. It feels lazy, which is another complaint- some of the lines, some of the arcs here, just feel lazy. I think Eugenides generally does a good job handling gender in this, especially given it was written 20 years ago, and even felt some of the elements of Cal’s transition and experience of it are interesting. But god, do you really need to put lines about how men’s bathrooms are stinky and women’s bathrooms smell like flowers?  Of course Cal’s brother goes away to college and comes back a hippie who despises the small business owner father; that’s fine and good, but do I need his girlfriend moaning during sex about tearing down dad’s private property? There’s a few elements also where Eugenides sneaks in political commentary that feels like Twitter commentators putting it in their children’s mouths- 8 year old Cal calling the Detroit riots “the Second American Revolution” feels like Ruthkanda Forever in novel form, even if it’s a take I find interesting and probably agree with. I can go on with more examples, but at the end of the day Eugenides feels like he lost faith in the story he’s telling being compelling on its own terms and felt the need to both spice up the history and embellish on the details to appeal to some mythical normal reading. <br/><br/>With that long paragraph of hate aside, I did like lots of this! Its ending swept me away in the way it tied together years of history both personal and cultural, of tragedies passed down (quite literally, in terms of the chromosome in Cal’s body) from generation to generation!

There are moments where he allows himself to let loose with his writing, but only when the moment calls for it; his handling and writing of the disabled victim, hardly able to communicate for herself, is one of the most emotionally devastating things put to the page, full of grace and respect and dignity for someone fighting to recover to be themself again. It’s all filled with such respect for humanity, of what is to be human, the things that sparked her joy, the choices and sacrifice and commitments and love she gave to her family, the choices that define a life, it’s really quite inspiring. That the family allowed it and Murakami dealt with it in such a sensitive manner is such a remarkable combination; those two chapters absolutely ruined me, and would make this a special book even if I didn’t like the rest as much as I did. It’s a shame that this book seems to be filed under minor Murakami because I sincerely doubt he ever wrote anything better.<br/><br/>Murakami says at some point that he wrote this in part to try to understand Japan better; and I think this does a good job of establishing the everyday before the devastation, mundanity crossed with terror, the socioeconomic climate of Japan at the time in the wake of bubbles bursting and prosperity for its citizens in serious doubt in the wake of a recession, as well as the mundanity continuing around them, people foaming at the mouth as people push by to get to work. One wants to draw lines between that mundane everyday and the second half, of the cult arising and eventually turning to terrorism, but the interviewees don’t draw that connection for you- at most, one can infer a lack of spirituality in the culture at large, pushing those with a natural predilection, who feel something missing, to the fringes of society. I found this second section of cult members much less interesting, even if it’s superficially more fascinating; perhaps the lack of answer, how and why this could happen, could never satisfy, or perhaps Murakami was more inspired and qualified to comment on the everyday rather than the extraordinary nature of the cult.","day_read": "2024/06/16"},"out_stealing": {"title": "Out Stealing Horses", "author": "Per Petterson", "stars": "3", "review": "Didn’t love this necessarily, a little cinematic in the writing for me, but has a very defined mood/register that I think it pulls off pretty phenomenally (and I don’t think it’s an easy one to hit).

The real horror is a life spent watching other people live their lives while you just kind of pass through mindlessly, staring in the mirror at the back of your own head, unable to know yourself (a painting it directly references), leading to a final chapter of escape to the woods to work on a cabin so that you can die alone.

As is, a sentence that cuts off midway, the main character leaning in to listen to something that will bring him no closer to any answer, is probably the most fitting ending that this could have. <br/><br/>When this clicks, I found this super evocative- the weirdness and paranoia of a society and social conventions that seem backwards, the reaching at an authority that the world is designed to keep you from, that may not exist at all, or at least not in a form that you are expecting it. This book put me in strange, alienated moods. When it’s off, it can feel like a chore- there’s a few conversations in here that feel like they take an eternity, this book is just page after page of people talking for the most part and when it doesn’t hit right it really doesn’t hit right.<br/><br/>Some really wonderful imagery and humor here- loved all the shuffling of papers, be it in the house of the village mayor or with the high ranking officials at the village inn. Bureaucratic competence, the idea of power and authority with intention and meaning, is an illusion we all co-create, from those in it all the way to the low ranking villager.

Watts is a PhD in a science field, and it shows for ways both good and bad- a little too much nerdy hard sci fi stuff in here, but also a wide range of knowledge that allows him to delve deeper into the possibilities presented by evolution and the nature of consciousness. <br/><br/>There's plenty of interesting angles on consciousness in here, but they can all go in a textbook if the imagery and the vibes of this don't come together. Luckily, they do- the ever expanding crown of thorns of the alien spaceship, the hallucinations lurking in the shadows of the crew's explorations, the tentacled aliens stalking them and experimented on- they all, along with the slow trickle of discoveries, create an atmosphere of horrified curiosity that carries the reader through and becomes even more effective when that atmosphere turns inward on the crew and their motivations. <br/><br/>The future of Blindsight is one of increased technology, humans literally getting brain surgery to make them less human, to remove unpleasant memories, turn their processing into a supercomputer and in the process remove their capacity for human emotions, sex had solely online and never in the flesh, humans going to the 'Heaven' of an online server and leaving their body and their friends and lovers behind. Vampires are real, and have been tamed to serve human needs- but their consciousness is not like ours, having no sense of past or future, no real sense of self. Despite their attempts to remove it, humans have their consciousness, are still trapped to the almighty 'I', even in light of their efforts to distance themselves surgically- and this proves to be a weakness against the alien crawlers, who have no consciousness but are remarkably intelligent, all the brain power devoted to maintaining a self-image loosened to cultivate collective intelligence, to problem solve at levels we cannot comprehend. The humans have no hope to overwhelm the intelligence once forced to come into conflict with it- the end is only them suicide bombing the alien ship, mutually assured destruction by two types of brain that cannot make sense of the others- the human attempt at language and communication a hostile attack for the aliens, the alien layout totally incomprehensible to the human brain.<br/><br/>Of course, the end has our protagonist making his way back to Earth, his humanity restored in hostile fashion by the crew, only to discover that humanity has been overtaken by the vampires, their consciousness remaining their undoing as the higher evolved vampires overtake them on the planet, leaving Siri (yes, that's the protagonist's name) the lone human, the last conscious being floating along in space alone. It creates an emotional moment, the last being feeling the end for human connection alone in space, and an interesting juxtaposition: our protagonist, who imploded relationships and desired to return to what he was before surgery triumphantly understanding what it was to be human again, feeling again and regaining a purer form of consciousness all while humanity as a whole has seemingly gone extinct due to that same consciousness. It's a swirl of mixed emotions, one that evokes how I imagine Watts feels about consciousness: a horror, a beauty, the possibilities for beauty and connection and cruelty and pain all colliding.

I’ll go back to read the others, but I recommend this one on its own terms. <br/><br/>As far what I loved about, it’s the type of gonzo sci-fi I tend to go, mushroom men taking over the world and trying to build a tower in the middle of the city, spewing mushroom drugs to a sedated populace, having the ability to turn men into mushroom hybrids with the memories of other humans. A case with two bodies unidentifiable, possibly from other dimensions- the ability to take a mushroom that will transport you to moments of their life, possibly last moments. A dark, gritty, wet, sopping city with a great deal of thought into its history, its character, the backdrop of its past running into the actions of the characters of the present to the unwritten future of it. Some crazy collapsing of time twists going on throughout. Police for an occupying regime, caught in the middle of making a living and what they believe, the reclamation of the city- the struggle for the city’s freedom not the only force fighting to be free, an indigenous population who believes both competing ideals are illegitimate. <br/><br/>Definitely falls into some detectivey hardass tropes, but 1.)

When the moments of emotion between father and daughter actually come in, it feels like a flood of emotion, a breaking of a dam. The reflections on lower class masculinity are particularly insightful here- Ernaux’s father has pride, sure, but pride at mostly not embarrassing himself, shame (and avoidance of it) the driving factor of how he conducts himself, how he sees himself. It is a sad prison, but one that Ernaux finds the dignity in, the joy in- in that he provided a life, that she was able to achieve everything he wanted for her, that he was able to find the joys he did find.","day_read": "2024/04/10"},"the_three-body": {"title": "The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #1)", "author": "Liu Cixin", "stars": "4", "review": "Think this one works almost entirely by virtue of its mystery/detective style framing, bread crumbing the reader along with enough hints and misdirections to scoot them past the paper thin characters.

The game (the human computer!) in particular I think is a pretty exceptional case of laying out the science of it, why it’s interesting in a theoretical sense, and why it’s important to the narrative itself all in one go. Some of the higher dimensional stuff towards the end with the creation of the Sophons was a little lost on me, but the end result was still legible to me. <br/><br/>Maybe it’s because I’m less versed on Chinese culture, but also found this interesting in terms of how China sees itself and the fallout to its Cultural Revolution. The scene of Ye Wenjie meeting the Red Guards who killed her father, victims of history just as much as she is, and their refusal to apologize for the tides that brought them up and tore them down, I found really interesting; and Wenjie’s lost in faith that humanity can be redeemed, that they transcend those tides, surprisingly all worked on both a theoretical and somewhat (for this type of book) emotional level. <br/><br/>Also distinctly Chinese in its faith that humanity could band together as a whole through government agencies and cooperation to take down an existential threat.

The legacy of Indonesia, and of American meddling in the Third World in the 60s, is all but settled. Which makes Bevins work here, to try to figure out the legacy of protest movements of the 2010s in roughly real time, all the more challenging and all the more impressive that he manages to pull it off. <br/><br/>Protest is the language of the 2010s (the subtitle calls it the “protest decade”), and much of the discussion here. Bevins covers a wide swath of countries (Egypt, Bahrain, Ukraine, Turkey, Brazil, Tunisia, South Korea, Chile Hong Kong, amongst others- the US is briefly touched on but not a primary focus), all united in form of protest, all united in galvanizing the masses far beyond the typical protests, all for the most part united in unsatisfying outcomes. Some were able to overthrow the existing state, only to find opposing forces fill the power vacuum; others were co-opted to empower right wing organizations, or had their message go so broad so as to become meaningless/diluted.<br/><br/>Common to all these is the tool they use (mass protest) and the distrust of hierarchy or organization. Bevins spends a short time tracing this back, to the New Left and to anti-Soviet sentiments discrediting traditional forms of hierarchy, as well as to Dave Graeber and prefigurative living- the only way to build a world that has no hierarchies is to not have any for your social justice organizing. It is a compelling argument in theory, but in practice it led to disaster- organizations striving to reach consensus voting spending hours on minutia, the media’s search for a voice for the protest (which Bevins describes accurately as a media action first and foremost) being left to the non-ideological crowd rather than the organizations responsible for starting the movement in the first place. <br/><br/>A lot of time is spent on the influence of social media, how it influenced the movement and how it was covered. The movements listed all took tactics, imagery, ideas from each other, for better or worse, referencing each other directly, partially for media coverage, partially in inspiration, and partially in a very real display of international solidarity. The influence is not all positive, even if the media’s view of it was unquestioning worship, that technology would spread democracy (where have I heard that before?) and justice to the world- it frequently contributed to the diffuse nature of these events, led to their underlying ideologies being undermined and hijacked, led to the participants being trackable and findable in the immediate aftermath. The inspiration can be good- but also, as he points out, what works in the first world for drawing attention can get you killed in Bahrain or Egypt. These movements should be inspired by each other in ways, but each context demands its own set of tactics and approaches, and the flattening power of social media does not reveal that, leading to very real consequences for those users.<br/><br/>Bevins spends his last chapter reflecting on protest with his interviewees- at one point, he asks one of the Brazilian protestors if they could’ve accomplished their goal through backroom politicking rather than mass action, would they have taken it and the protestor tellingly, despite the aftermath in part leading to Bolsonaro, says no. At the very least, he seeks to define the use of a protest as a tool in the toolkit, as a media action, as a way of grabbing attention, rather than as the main and only recourse and method of enacting change. The book seems to be far more focused on ends based politics, noting the Chilean protestors taking up positions in government (despite being called sellouts or traitors) as a success story of enacting positive change from events such as these. He closes on a haunting question- is it possible that these actions, these moments when the masses of humanity take to the street and rise up, where the participants feel they are making history, connected despite their alienation, as one society fighting for justice- could those moments be just those feelings, dangerous privileged adventurism, a drug as harmful as any other- “If you want the feeling of mass ecstasy, you should go to a music festival instead of encouraging vulnerable young people to go out and get killed,” as he puts it up. Or are they reflective of something real, of something to come, of a world where citizens cocreate their own reality rather than living alienated, distanced, injust lives? Bevins and his interviewees are split- he gives no answer, and that answer is likely for the decades to come to decide.","day_read": "2024/03/01"},"exquisite_corpse": {"title": "Exquisite Corpse", "author": "Poppy Z.

Beyond that, I found this most interesting as commentary/evocation of AIDS crisis gay life, people abandoned and thrust into vulnerability by their families, by society at large, and the accompanying feelings of anger and loneliness. That loneliness and isolation all makes them ripe for the pickings for the novel’s cannabilistic serial killers, who cherish the flesh they were told was sinful and unsalvageable, who exploit that connection to lead them to their final, horrific doom. It all makes sense in a very 90s style metaphor way that I don't think you could ever get away with writing today, for better or worse.

This was one I didn’t want to end so it’s about as good as you can get for a celebration book.<br/><br/>Feels most like spending hours in Dillard’s head, an introduction to her pet interests and seeing the world rather than constructing any sort of clear throughline from chapter to chapter, outside of the passage of time throughout the year. The joy is that Dillard’s way of thinking is one dominated first and foremost by curiosity and wonder and detail, where everything she sees holds beauty, or at least fascination. It is a book first and foremost about detail, sometimes directly talking about it, sometimes showing it, and is proof that intimate knowledge does not preclude joy or wonder but enhances it.<br/><br/>Has some religious undertones (and overtones) to it, which usually I find hugely alienating but this one gets away it for the sheer reverence that it lives out for the world and the many quirks of the creatures within it (and because it doesn’t do much evangelizing). In a way, made explicit in its conclusion, this becomes a manifesto for how to live life, how to experience the world as a human in a world filled with so many inhuman elements. <br/><br/>Stylistically is very young person writing their first novel, which all the more benefits its core aspirations, full of stretches at beauty and long, flowy sentences that capture natural beauty and the continuous experience of focus and flow in harmony with the world incredibly well. The section with the dog in the gas station, mountains (that I’ve hiked!) in the background, a moment of pure conscious (but not self-conscious) pleasure, is one that’ll stick with me for a long time. <br/><br/>Most closely evokes that feeling of catching a deer in a clearing and making eye contact, both of you still, waiting for the other to make a move, trying to discern the secret intentions of the other.

Sure, it’s got its head up its own ass (or someone else’s), but that’s it doing it what it says in the tin. <br/><br/>Much like Lauren Oyler’s much more recent Fake Accounts, the line between author and narrator is thin, the narrator being a Jewish women from Toronto named Sheila who’s a writer struggling with writer’s block. Perhaps because spawned a fair amount of imitators and similar books (including Oyler, who’s reviewed Heti) since it dropped in 2010, I did not find this one to be as enduring as the more contemporary. However, I think it does do a good job of capturing 21st century urban solipsism in a way that I think has only grown more prescient with time, the desire for fame and the world’s eyes without the work put in, the preoccupation with moral framings and meaning and some abstract pure sense of authenticity, the overconsidered yet careless way of going through lives. In a way some of its depiction feels quaint, as social media has only intensified and brought out more of what she’s talking about. <br/><br/>While I didn’t find the critiques as satisfying as Oyler, I did find parts of this really shined which saved it. I actually really loved some of the sex writing in here, crude power dynamics and ideas of servitude, shame, and desire all playing out. She’s too smart to dole out an actual answer to her own framing question, leaving some vignettes and thoughts, the image of players slamming a squash ball with joy and no idea the rules of the game a beautiful counterpoint to the neurotic handwringing the novel had done to that point. The preoccupations about how to be are all a way of nullifying the way that you are, hiding from the impact and identity you have, the personal touch brought out in everything you touch, as when Sheila’s friend tries to make an ugly painting and ends up creating something beautiful. In the end it ends in a really sincere place of valuing humanity and each other in all its messiness and ugliness that I can’t help but to admire for a book that is endowed with plenty of detachment and irony.","day_read": "2023/12/30"},"fake_accounts": {"title": "Fake Accounts", "author": "Lauren Oyler", "stars": "4", "review": "Have tossed and turned on how much I really liked this one, but it’s stuck in my head long enough that I’m inclined to veer into the positive direction. Can’t say I’d recommend to anyone who isn’t extremely Online or Twitter brained, but for that subset I think this has the potential to land. <br/><br/>The line between artist and narrator is blurred, as the narrator has a Twitter avatar identical to the author’s, lives in Berlin as the author does, and retains the same voice that you would expect from a Twitter user. Oyler, in her critique of Jia Tolentino’s Trick Mirror, accuses Tolentino of using the world as a mirror to get insight into herself, whereas a more refined artist uses their experience as an entry point to make points about the world, as well as that Tolentino’s vulnerability and authenticity and messiness is actually carefully crafted to present herself in the best light. I mention this because this is an interesting counterpoint; if Oyler is crafting an image of herself, it’s certainly not a flattering one. And while the narrator is plenty self-obsessed, I do think Oyler is branching to the world with her own experience, although much of it is critiquing insular Online detachment from one’s own experiences and events, irony poisioning to the nth degree. There was multiple times reading this and straightened up in my chair and said “Do I sound like this?” which is probably a good sign that she’s hitting her marks. If one were to read the narrator with the slightest bit of sympathy, I could see the total disdain which the rest of the world seems to have for this book. <br/><br/>Given the subject matter, wish this one had a tiny bit more to say about conspiracy, although there’s some amusing bits of humor in here about it. SPOILERS The twist ending really does serve as a triple-pronged evisceration of this style poisoning and its impact on our relationships, one where both players can be checked out entirely and carry out, one where a romantic partner can be faked a death upon as a funny prank, and one where one does not bother to check upon the actual details of the death of a boyfriend. It’s all an absurd farce, of ironic detachment directed at the world bleeding into and subsuming your most intimate relationships. The many, many dating app dates presented here (I can feel the readers groaning) and even her interactions with other Berliners play into this- at no point does she allow herself to be herself to anyone, always lying, farming for stories and laughs, to the point where the only self that is herself lives in her head. <br/><br/>Overall, a lot of this comes down to how you feel about the voice, which I find compelling but then again I’ve been on Twitter for a decade so your mileage may vary. Has a funny critique of fragmentary writing that actually kind of works in the middle of it, which I’m sure can and has been interpreted as obnoxious.","day_read": "2023/10/19"},"a_philosophy": {"title": "A Philosophy of Software Design", "author": "John Ousterhout", "stars": "0", "review": "","day_read": "2023/12/15"},"life_a": {"title": "Life: A User's Manual", "author": "Georges Perec", "stars": "5", "review": "Another literary experiment by Perec, this time him going room by room through a Parisian apartment building, chronicling the inhabitants, their decorations, the history of both tenants and the room itself. Time is frozen, 8 PM- there is only what has happened in the past, and the scene at that time. He traverses the 10x10 building as a knight on a chess board, traversing every room without repeating once, dedicating a chapter to each room in the building. This means characters slide in and out quickly, although the connections between tenants help retain a sense of continuity.<br/><br/>A book covering this much space clearly has a lot on its mind, themes sliding in and out of frame. However, the framing itself serves as a theme, the apartment building (and rooms) as a character, one subject to changing tides, styles gaining and losing prominence, neighborhoods changing in character around them, landlords and managers swapping hands. Perec is dedicated to the history of the building as much as anything, a room meaning one thing for one tenant and another, that tenant’s character and story being very different to the one before them. As ***********An Attempt*********** made us perceive the ordinary things happening at that moment, *****Life***** makes us perceive the hidden histories before us in the rooms of any building that we enter. The quality of the rooms themselves is also in frame, a high attention to the details of adornments that tenants have decided to put in, each telling its own small tale of who the tenant is and what the place stands for.<br/><br/>The one connecting much of the building together is Bartlebooth, a rich financier who goes on a quest to learn to paint, then travels the world painting sunsets, sends the paintings to a puzzle maker in the building, solves the puzzle, and then immediately has it destroyed, hoping to leave no trace of his quest. There is, of course, much to say about this quest, its meaning being total self-erasure, the idea that human achievement is futility, existence disappearing completely upon one’s expiration as if they had never been there before. Of course, Bartlebooth can’t succeed in even this, going blind and then dying in his quest, plenty of puzzles left to complete, the final puzzle he worked on with one piece missing, the piece in his hand not matching the missing square in front of him. A piece of us always remains in every space we vacate, no matter if we like it or not. The quest for a solution to life, treating it as a puzzle, is a futile one, one we’re doomed to fail and leave incomplete. <br/><br/>Futility pervades, judge’s failing in their marriage till they commit to a life of crime that disgraces them, cyclists injuring themselves and recommiting themselves to aiding other cyclists only to injure them too, painters on quests they never complete. Every character, every room, has a story, one that fascinates in a different direction, in absurd and novel ways, but commonalities in the stories tie them together. Living in a country that actively hates its neighbors, that fetishizes the isolated homestead, this perhaps hits a little different. <br/><br/>There’s plenty on the folly of modernity, iterating on kitchens, on hotels in new directions, the building and its inhabitants a witness to a shifting world, one moving in a consumerist and increasingly commodity fetishized direction- some tenants are able to profit from it, some are attempting to isolate from it, some are left behind by it. But still, the building stands, only increasing in the amount of people it houses, the stories it holds, the meanings present. An enigmatic classic. A self-help book only in the most abstract sense, despite what its title suggests to curious passer-by.","day_read": "2023/12/09"},"an_attempt": {"title": "An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris", "author": "Georges Perec", "stars": "4", "review": "A man sits in different locations around a square in Paris, cataloguing only what he sees in front of him, the passing of commuter and tourist buses, of people walking to and fro, of pigeons making their senseless migrations.

That's all this is. It is mostly an exercise in attention, both for reader and writer, to be able to focus on the small minute details, eliminate the pre-processing your brain does at every opportunity and view the world as it is. At a certain point, he questions why he’s doing it, what he came to the square to accomplish. I’m sure every reader of this has done the same. Eventually, despite Perec’s flat styling to emphasize the mundanity, poetry seeps in, small moments of human beauty or absurdity, the hum of a city in motion, in the midst of these small, extra-sensory happenings.","day_read": "2023/10/20"},"last_evenings": {"title": "Last Evenings on Earth", "author": "Roberto Bolaño", "stars": "5", "review": "In classic Bolano fashion, has a sledgehammer ending, one that clarifies and expands upon everything that’s been written before. Just an absolute stunning section: <br/><br/>“54. The children of the Spanish lion, said Ruben Dario, a born optimist. The children of Walt Whitman, Jose Marti, and Violeta Parra; torn apart, forgotten, in mass graves, at the bottom of the sea, the Trojan destiny of their mingled bones terrifying the survivors. <br/>55. I think of them this week as the veterans of the Internal Brigades visit Spain: little old men climbing down from the buses, brandishing their fists. They were 40,000 of them, and 350 or so have come back to Spain. <br/>56. I think of Beltran Morales, I think of Rodrigo Lira, I think of Maria Santiago, I think of Reinaldo Arenas. I think of the poets who died under torture, who died of AIDS, or overdose, all those who believe in a Latin American paradise and died in a Latin American hell. I think of their works, which may, perhaps, show the Left a way out of the pit of shame and futility.” <br/><br/>From there, he closes the book talking of Paulo Neruda, how every Chilean poet will toil in anonymity, his name above them and representing them all in eternity, while the contemporary poets will be in jail or asylums. It is, of course, cruelly ironic that Bolano’s name could replace Neruda’s, the one star from Chile that represents the entire country, the one that Westerners can read and cross Chile off their list of countries they understand, the countries who’s art they’ve drank from. <br/><br/>But Bolano’s tale in this (and throughout his work) is that of the minor artists, the survivors terrified of mingled bones, those brandishing their fists, those who toiled in anonymity, who fought and lived as if they were a star but whose work and life are erased the second they’re extinguished. The children of the failed dreams of the 20th century, wandering North America and Europe, far from home, drifting without a place to call their own, their battle already lost. The short stories ache with melancholy, sadness, lost dreams, senseless conflict and violence. That of course is not the full sum of the stories, and neither is of those lives, but even in the more upbeat of the stories there is a tinge of that hanging over every story, beauty existing in spite of circumstance. <br/><br/>Maybe my favorite Bolano?

Does a good job sprinkling in some less straightforward aspects that aren’t easy political selling points- thinking specifically of the Wet as being sort of a community, a unified organism, and the gardener who plants bodies in construction, seemingly implying with his thoughts that the problem with new development is the lack of respect for tradition, the real estate developer looking to sell The Wet as some form of a bioweapon, slightly thornier, less obvious aspects than could be implied from a one sentence summary of the book. A lot of the character work didn’t work that much for me and wish it had skewed a little darker/graphic, like Sullivan’s previous novel Waste, but it’s a page turner and the core concepts/imagery are good here.

James", "stars": "4", "review": "Wanted to read something by this guy and had heard his book on Haitian revolution was a bit dry, so figured I’d try him writing about sports. Turned out to be a bit dry as well, but found some stuff of interest here, primarily because I know nothing about cricket. <br/><br/>James is most interesting when he’s evaluating the importance and meaning of the sport in its different contexts. He ties cricket’s rise in England to the transition of feudalism to capitalism and industrialization, the stars of the sport and its nature a tie for the people back to their roots, a way of connecting to some lost past. The rise of sports generally in the 20th century coincides with this; and he notes in particular that the way the people interact with sports is changing, that they are more focused on the individuals rather than teams and cities comprising them, and that for cricket to retain relevance it needs to transition in that direction. For the Trinidadians, the sport is handed to them by their colonizers, and for the colonizers it is a tool to instill certain values, values that help keep the colonized subjects in control and compliant with the occupying regime. Of course, it also presents the subjects an opportunity to prove their worth, that they are the equals of them on the field, a scoreboard to show what they know to be true. <br/><br/>The information about the different clubs in Trinidad is interesting, the teams representing an array of interests, both in class and color. The history of the Trinidad captaincy, that only white players were allowed to be selected even as black players far surpassed them, and the struggle to fix that and the negative impact that had on the team’s credibility with the nation and its ability to perform on the field, is chronicled throughout and in much depth. Beyond the politics of it, also found James to be at some of his most compelling when he lifts and elevates cricket to artform, his chronicles and admiration of swings and bowls attempting to lift the great sportsmen of his age to the level of poets and novelists (and made me seek out cricket highlights on Youtube)<br/><br/>Can’t say I’d recommend it to a non-cricket fan, and there were some sections I contemplated not completing, but there was also a lot of beauty and interesting detail to be found here as well.","day_read": "2023/10/27"},"the_beginning": {"title": "The Beginning of the End: France, May 1968", "author": "Angelo Quattrocchi", "stars": "4", "review": "An interesting literary experiment around the student protests/general strike in France of 68, the first half being a poetic recounting of events from someone on the ground, the second a more academic theoretical take on the events. <br/><br/>The first is definitely the highlight of the book, Quattrochi’s prose poem carrying the fervor and passion of revolution as if he wrote it as the events were occurring. The rise of the movement is intoxicating, students protesting over gendered dormitories and better learning conditions in mass confrontation with the power of the state, the rest of the country watching in horror before joining in, the demands and aims of the movement spiraling into a countrywide transformation of life, all rising up to bring an economy, a president, the existing power structure (literally turning off the power!) to its knees, perhaps the greatest show of force by a working class movement ever in the Western world, before being brutally beaten back by the state. The potential is felt, both in ideas, of a movement finding itself as it grows, finding that the old revolutionary concepts are not fit for their moment and working to find new ones, a total transformation of life, and in action, as what starts small grows and grows until it can bring a country to its knees and bring the possibility of real power to the table. If there’s a critique of this section, it’s that the fall is abbreviated, the exact events abstracted, while there’s a real clarity to how the rise occurs. Would imagine any history of 2020 would probably have a similar arc and lack of clarity, so perhaps it’s not truly the fault of the author here.<br/><br/>The second I’m a little more mixed on it, and I find more interesting as an account of grappling with the events than really analysis. Nairn identifies the students as the new force with the revolutionary potential, disregarding the old traditional working class and political parties and unions with them. For a moment, around the world, USA, France, and elsewhere, he was right- students reliably being the force that resisted and tried to build new structures. However, in hindsight, it’s clear that that was a blip, the last outcry of the youth against the turning of the university from a place of learning and human growth to job training, a servant to the needs and demands of the economy rather than a refuge from it. When was the last time a student movement made any sort of wave? The students have internalized the logic of the market, scared to compromise academic standing and job prospects. Still, this analysis is interesting, as Nairn is trying to find a new center of political potential since the traditional working class structures of union and party have not delivered substantial change and the basic needs of (most) everyone are being met, leading to a complacency and lack of fervor that might have been once necessary and core to the movements.<br/><br/>Has some of my favorite quotes around working class revolt I’ve ever read, particularly: <br/><br/>“The astronomers at Meudon are on strike, not for money, for more stars.”","day_read": "2023/11/25"},"filthy_animals": {"title": "Filthy Animals", "author": "Brandon  Taylor", "stars": "4", "review": "Read this one awhile ago, so don’t have a ton of in-depth thoughts remaining in my head.

It’s not my favorite of hers, but it’s up there and it’s packed into a size that can be read in a week or so rather than some of her far more demanding work.<br/><br/>What struck me more on this read through was the nature of the doubling and the contrast between Septimus and Clarissa, two beings unstuck from time and their surroundings yet intimately connected to those surroundings, seemingly the two poles of Woolf herself, one mentally ill, unable to meet society’s standards and ultimately suicidial, and the side that can maintain the house and what her husband and polite society demand of her, as well as the two sides of British society, the one that suffers and gives their life so that the other can host fancy dinner parties where that suffering is merely an interruption and small talk conversation. The dichotomy builds and builds until it reaches its zenith, with Septimus leaping out the window in a moment of freedom and despair and Clarissa hosting the prime minister, stirring terror and awe at the woman that she is from her oldest friend and jilted lover, yet requiring a moment amidst her hosting duties to ponder the death of the (unknown to her) Septimus. <br/><br/>Other things that stuck out to me on this read through is how she depicts the city as a living, breathing, flowing organism, jumping from head to head, location to location, every location and every head a fountain of its own beauty and chaos all combining to form the tapestry of London. How aging is used against the characters both by themselves and by each other, feeling the winnowing of possibilities, the end drawing nearer, accomplishments not yet and never to be made held as a shortfall, the years accumulating to form memories of loves lost and flashing back to the time where choice was something they had and living in the obligations they posses now. The love between Clarissa and Sally, never allowed to mean anything, perhaps purer because it never could mean anything- the way their husband’s names take precedence over there’s in any formal setting, only their first names when in the comfort of each other’s company, their worth to society at large defined far more by the last name than the first now that they are of age. The moment of flowers between Richard and Clarissa, the knitting between Septimus and Rezia, tiny imperfect moments of love and affection in imperfect marriages- all that is left unsaid, that we cannot say, but is still understood.<br/><br/>There’s a million other things I could write paragraphs on, because this book and Woolf are that good, but I don’t need to go back to writing seven paragraphs for these again.

You learn to love it.<br/><br/>The spectacle, as Debord defines it, is the separation of people from their actual lived reality- that everything around them has ceased to be real and has been replaced by a representation of reality, every desire, interaction, part of life mediated by the logic of capital, by images beamed into your head from the day you were born to the day you die. The image is the tool of the spectacle, endlessly manipulatable- 'an identification of all human social life with appearances.' You can imagine Debord in his grave spinning over Instagram. The spectacle exists to justify existing reality, to subsume any critique into its web (watch the new Black Mirror! It critiques Netflix- on Netflix!), to manufacture isolation and alienation, separating neighbor from neighbor, worker from production, individual from society. Our cities don't exist for the inhabitants- they exist for tourists to pass through, for cars to drive through on highways built on top of the rubble of neighborhoods and communities not deemed valuable. Commodities have lost all tie to their use value or price to produce, fetishized to the point of total abstraction, prices rising and falling on the whims of CEOs, with no one capable of understanding the steps it took to bring a strawberry into your refrigerator (and it having no tie to the seasonal element of life that used to define reality). Divisions between political parties are real in a sense, but offer no way out of the existing way of life. What is true becomes a matter of what feed you are plugged into. <br/><br/>Debord's way out in anti-ideology, a belief that to escape one must be present in the moment, adapting to the existing situation rather than holding on to old ideas not built for the present moment. The re-integration of the people into historical events, to having your actions impact the world around you, is the way through, in Debord's estimation, through the classic idea of the worker council, is the only way out of his idea of the mental turning against itself (he terms it 'schizophrenia')  that accepting the spectacle on its own terms creates. He, of course, spends more time diagnosing problems than he does offering solutions, but that fits into the project of allowing the moment to dictate action rather than old (even his too shall become old, as they are now) ideas.<br/><br/>The thing it reminded most was this quote from Iran after the US assassinated Suleimani: <br/><br/>'[In the situation] that we take one of theirs now that they've got one of ours — who should we consider to take out in the context of America? Think about it. Are we supposed to take out Spider-Man and SpongeBob? They don't have any heroes.

That is the concluding image of novel, but in a way, that is the entirety of it, the fates of each individual character written in their names and the stars, traveling like pieces down an assembly line, straining against and leaning into the fate that they were always going to reach in the end. The town, doomed from the start, the desire to reach and connect to the ocean following down the family lines until it brings about the train that brings the colonizers that devastate the people and ultimately the land completely until neither of them exist. They were all doomed from the start; but does that make their fate any less tragic? <br/><br/>The constant through the generations are the names (confusingly) and the traits that come with them, but also the titular solitude, a source of comfort in some, a source of pain in others, a way of leaving the world and each other out in all. They escape each other through labor, be it knitting, keeping the house, making treats, various other lovers, sewing gold fishes, but all of them escape companionship, be it explicitly rejecting rejecting romantic suitors or an implicit hardening of the heart against the others in the family who are in fact doing the same thing to them too. Only the last of the family can find love in each other, and in incestual form that ultimately dooms the family to its eradication (and to the long foreseen pig tail child), a twisted reminder that the escape from solitude was always in that house with that family but none could grasp it in any lasting way. <br/><br/>Beautifully written, stylistically invigorating, just an awesome book on every level.

Reading much of Fanon’s warnings to leaders at the time reads like a prediction of how colonial countries were successfully able to transition out of colonialism into a still extractive, dominant relationship with their ex-colonies. Fanon’s insistence on the need for reparations, for the colonizers to provide the tools (soil studies, outside capital) for the colonized to survive on their own, was the least heeded for this reason: the transition state were either beholden to the parasitic outsider or to starve on their own. Fanon’s assessment of the necessity of violence, both for the psyche of the people and to make the necessary break from the colonizing country, his detailing of how the native bourgeoise of the colonized are insufficient for African countries to reach first world standards of living, his assessment of the pacification of the post revolutionary natives by the popular revolutionary, the need for the resistance to go outside the city and into the rural areas to find broad power and the heart of the nation, his reframing of nationalism outside of a Western, reactionary context, the need for the masses to be educated on not just the evil of the colonized but of the nation they are trying to build: all incredibly laid out, all compelling, all understandable to someone without a university degree in this sort of thing.<br/>The psychological profiles at the end feel like a footnote to the broader, far reaching societal ideas, but found that to be perhaps the most compelling portion of the text: the mentality and injustice that Fanon spent pages detailing and describing its impact localized to single individuals, colonizer and colonized, suffering the symptoms of the injustices they suffered under or helped impose.

He is slotting works into his own taxonomy of the weird and the eerie; the weird being a presence there that feels like it does not belong- whether it actually does not or it is outside the realm of the knowledge of the perceiver, the eerie being the absence of a presence that should be there (in two categories, the failure of absence (the feeling that there is something where there shouldn't be, i.e. a call of a bird that sounds like it has intent not characteristic of a bird), and the failure of presence (i.e., cityscapes overtaken by foliage and totally absent of human life)). <br/><br/>Fisher is far better when he's defining and analyzing the weird in fiction, analyzing it from different angles and eras. With the eerie he tends to drift away from it and return to it as he wraps up his thoughts on a work, which is perhaps a testament to how slippery the concept can be. He brings up capital as perhaps the ultimate eerie force- a failure of presence, the machinations that guide our lives and the world lacking a man behind the curtain pulling the strings, nothing human to latch onto to blame for the way things are. Perhaps, as he mentions repeatedly throughout Capitalist Realism, that is why it is hard for him to wrap his arms around it, as it is the water he is swimming in each day. <br/><br/>Particularly loved the Picnic at Hanging Rock, Lynch, Under The Skin, Lovecraft, and Phillip K Dick portions.

The weird timeline shenanigans and epistolary portions and changing perspectives add to this, the idea of never getting your head around what's happening around you, of only vague feelings of dread, doom, and uncertainty. If there's a sort of unifying thought, it's of the men throughout the narrative being already dead, both spiritually and in a fatalistic way, all their schemes and attempted loves an attempt to put off the inevitable and grasp at fleeting pleasure where no lasting stability or happiness is possible for them due to their condition. The women are a bit of cranks (it's Northern California after all), channeling spirits, doing mysticism, having Christian ecstasies, but they are far more in control of their fate and their desires than the men, even without the pretensions and plots.

To the end of the failings of the current system, Lefebvre zooms in on alienation, of people being disconnected from their work because they have no control over what they do or how their employer operates, as well as being disconnected from the facts of everyday life outside the home because of it- the idea of a total disconnect from work and life rather than them being integrated. Lefebvre forsees the future anti-work movements and strongly repudiates them- recognizing the importance of work to both the functioning of society and the spirit of man, while acknowledging the current mode of production has made it so that work does not properly fulfill either of those needs. Much of this is an acknowledgement of incomplete information- one, on the existing knowledge of everyday life, and there are many thoughts on how to properly study and capture that, and two, of what the future 'total man' would like, a man unburdened by alienation- he theorizes, but acknowledges that is impossible to know until man reaches that point.  <br/><br/>There's plenty of other stuff I'm neglecting, including a wholesale critique of religion taken from the French countryside, where all alienation in life is funneled into the church and totally captured, but there's a lot here and I read it a month ago.

At one point she has her author insert character ask the question of what does it matter, these domestic novels about friendship and love and the daily lives of normal people when the world is burning down around us and there's so much suffering in the third world propping up the first. All the while, the style here only leans further in, with plenty of descriptions of the most minute details of the character's life, a glance at a phone or the exact way they scrolled, and the most politically motivated character of the bunch admits that his foremost concern in life is really the two girls involved. In the end she doesn't come to a clear answer other than that is the way things are- one cannot take in the whole world in all its suffering, not all at once, and trying to do so is foolhardy, a path to misery. One's most intimate concerns are still the same: family, friends, love, community, and art that engages that sympathy will exist and be important as long as we have humans around to read it. Alice's answer seems to be that reading can elicit love akin to Jesus, a love with the expectation of nothing in return, a possible force for good, but in doing so acknowledges she cares for no one other than herself despite getting this feeling from literature. <br/><br/>To me, this represents a level-up in the prose as well, as Rooney improves in the sections where she flexes her muscles quite a bit (in particular the wedding scene was fantastic, capturing the beauty of the moment between Eileen and her mom/sister while also capturing the sadness of their arguments and their likely inability to actually reconcile them in spite of a beautiful moment in time) and her dialogue is in her typical cutting way, short words that cut to the core rather than trying to dance with too much of a realistic tone. <br/><br/>As usual, Rooney does a good job with accumulating details, the little resentments that pile up, who visited who, who didn't call who, who refuses to bare their soul and confess any genuine feelings, until they boil over, until the character reach a contradiction that demands resolution. And as it seems to occur in Rooney's novel, it's not always a grand change, but a small one, and an acceptance of the nature of other people, and one's fate in life. Normal People ends in accepting monogamy, in accepting throwing away one's own aspirations in order to be with other people, the ones you love- this one takes it a step forward, accepting monogamy, accepting irrelevance, and in Eileen's case even accepting having a child and raising them in the horrible world that presents her so much anxiety.","day_read": "2022/09/06"},"duino_elegies": {"title": "Duino Elegies", "author": "Rainer Maria Rilke", "stars": "5", "review": "Woefully unequipped to review poetry this good so I'll just quote one of my favorite sections: <br/><br/>We- we evaporate in our feelings.

CSW also felt far more concerned with labor/work expectations with reproduction and marriage as a secondary focus; this one reverses that and adds much more graphic content and taboo. The main character also feels slightly more relatable than Keiko in CSW- while she is still a strange one, much of her alienation is shaped by the trauma inflicted upon her by abusive unlistening parents and a molesting teacher (her mouth literally stops working for taste, as does one of her ears). The idea of sex and desire was with her at one point, and returns at another, but her experience in society leaves her feeling none of it while she is still trying to make her way inside. The “aliens” at the end and their actions feel like Murata expressing a comically exaggerated thesis statement of her fiction; the only way out is to tear down every thought, every preconception, even your participation in society, until all that is left is self preservation, animal instinct and your mind to try to start anew. That this leads to cannibalism and a cathartic exit to a spaceship is either a sign of the narrator’s total break from reality (and the futility of attempting to escape other people/the world at large) , or that in those moments they were finally able to throw off the eyes implanted in them by growing up in the world and were richly rewarded for it, whichever you decide.

There is no opportunity, no escape, no path out for the men trapped in the pit of the city- there is only shitty jobs that destroy your body, sleeping in a hovel for the rest of your days, precious few women around to distract from the loneliness and rage and disenfranchisement they experience. Waste is a dark novel, heads smashed in by the bottom of boots and bowling balls, lips melting in flames like wax on a candle, a trail of dead and broken bodies strewn across town, but it never feels unearned, the circumstances and desperation and thwarted masculinity all leading here. The plot of the novel, as much as it can be described, is bumbling, a collection of misunderstandings and mistakes leading only to more pain, more suffering, more rot in Larkhill. This is what happens when industry leaves a town, the jobs and the money flowing out, leaving teens to turn to neo-Nazism in search of any sort of meaning or purpose, a past to connect to, and the adults to turn to the opioids for the wounds they can't get the proper care for. <br/><br/>The closing image- a child gasping for air, trapped trying to take his own jacket off, a crowd of onlookers watching, sitting there, doing nothing, just taking in the spectacle of self destruction- feels apt for the novel, and the cities like Larkhill themselves in relation to the wealthy countries they reside in.","day_read": "2022/08/02"},"the_nickel": {"title": "The Nickel Boys", "author": "Colson Whitehead", "stars": "4", "review": "The prose in here can be a tad perfunctory, never anything wrong with it but not wowing you on a sentence level.

Think that's the mode I prefer for Brautigan, as evidenced by the overall 4 stars here- The Abortion starts incredibly promising, with the library of unpublished books that anyone can publish, an ode to amateur artistic creation- the women writing about growing plants in a windowless room was a moving metaphor for that process. However, once it shifts into the titular abortion, I found less to like- nothing wrong, just not terribly compelling. So The Wind Won't Blow It All Away is a little more in keeping with the Brautigan that I like- an ode to a pre televisual America, in all its dangers (as evidenced by the death of the poor kid) and its eccentricities. A family brings its living room to the river, fishing and not eating anything that it fishes, characters whittle their days on porches in mostly solitude and silence, kids run free of parental supervision. The death is Brautigan's tacit admission that this world he longs for was a more dangerous one, but one he felt home in- something weirder, indulgent of the strange ways humans conduct their lives, every individual made to construct their own meaning free from a box pumping them with prefigured purpose, forced to live outside in spaces with each other. Of the river living room couple, he says: <br/><br/>'It looked like a fairy tale functioning happily in the post-World War II gothic of America before television crippled the imagination of America and turned people indoors and away from living out their own fantasies with dignity.' <br/><br/>which may function as a thesis for a lot Brautigan's shtick as whole.

On one hand it is just a great chronicle of being on the cutting edge of surfing, riding spots no one else has ridden before, hopping from exotic country to exotic country and doing all the coolest life shit possible. Read just for that, this is a page turner and works exceptionally well on that level. But I found this far more interesting for its reflection on sport and aging, the sands of the world you were raised in and formed yourself changing around you leaving you either to wither away or do your best to change even if it's not the same and the scene (and your body) isn't as good as it used to be. The reflection in one of the final chapters of having to do exercises to maintain the ability to surf, that his youthful 'any exercise solely for the purpose of bodily maintenance is death; anything chasing something is life' is one I shared exactly and can no longer hold. And in general, Finnegan does a good job threading the needle on reflection, not chiding his young self for the decisions but accepting them and the reasoning behind them, and does a great job reporting the tension between freedom and commitment, chasing fun and excitement versus upholding commitment and fulfilling work/relationships, and how that evolves with time without casting too harsh an eye on his past decisionmaking. The San Francisco section where the old surfer speaks his piece 'against dereliction' is sort of the ethos of this- a commitment to pursuing life and the joy of their sport without abandoning the real world and being sucked into it entirely. <br/><br/>Also contains some of the best reflections on male friendship, and particularly male friendship in close proximity on trips I've seen, the butting of heads, the push and pull, the inevitable irritation with even their most simple habits. The reflections on youthful introductions to violence and how ingrained that was in America as a whole and in his childhood as a whole are detailed, every aspect of his life imperiled with it. One can see his surfing as a way of reconciling himself with that violence that lives inside him, finding harmony with the destructiveness in the waves by taming him on the board, and in some sense taming the testosterone and anger that lives inside of him. <br/><br/>Stylistically, Finnegan does a wonderful job of imparting lingo to the audience without repeating himself and describing the ferocity and grandeur of the ocean without repeating himself or growing tiresome. His tone never reaches too hard for self mockery or deprecation, which I think is what a times irritates me with memoir. <br/><br/>Got me to finally buck up and buy a surfboard, so you know it's good.","day_read": "2022/06/22"},"empire_of": {"title": "Empire of the Senseless", "author": "Kathy Acker", "stars": "4", "review": "GET RID OF MEANING. YOUR MIND IS A NIGHTMARE THAT HAS BEEN EATING YOU: NOW EAT YOUR MIND.<br/><br/>Feels very of a piece with Acker's Don Quixote, not just in her obvious stylistic trademarks of vulgarity and postmodern flourish, characters wondering the world fucking and fighting and hurting and loving with little narrative sense to their actions, no real arcs to be had, just hurt and demented characters lashing out at each other, loving and hating at the same time. The endings even mirror each other; Acker giving the final sentence to wish for a better world, one where the characters would not be abused and hurt, living on the fringes of society, made to be the outcasts they are. <br/><br/>Don Quixote is zeroed in on the Catholic church for a decent part of the narrative (at least in my years on recollection), where this one is broader, aiming at capitalism, the nuclear family, and of course the patriarchy. But yet even as she critiques the status quo, she prophetically (see: Arab Spring, Occupy, CHAZ, etc.) sees the failings of utopian politics in her Algerian revolution taking France- anger without clear defined purpose, a desire for power with no ideas on how to properly wield, a lack of organization and structure leading to violence and disorder, and, in the end, an inability to shrug off the logic of the present world even presented the chance to build a better world. 20 years before Mark Fisher coined 'capitalist realism,' Acker here has a text that embodies it. She presents no clear solutions, has no answers for what that better future she hopes for is- one almost reads the final chapter as a shrug of the shoulders, her character (as in Don Quixote) finding some semblance of peace but the society around them still the same, nothing but an undying hope in a possible better future to leave the text with. Her idea is to disregard the idea of meaning until one comes out on the other side with something different, but she cannot reach that other side alone, this text itself an experiment on trying to reach for it.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this retains a lot of Acker's punk energy, grotesque sex and violence, character motivations scattered across the board.

And if that’s not your bag, this one probably isn’t good enough to change your mind. But this one’s contempt for its characters is enough along with the unique voice to make this work for me as a compelling enough spin on the subgenre, especially given the sheer Freudianness of it all, especially when he’s buried at the tit of his ex co worker or crawling out of the metaphorical womb of the night into morning, begging the bread man for bread, a boy trapped in a man’s body, crying out for his mother who has left him alone on the Earth.

Unlike in The Atrocity Exhibition and Crash, however, Ballard is not interested in humanity advancing forward and bending to its new technologies and inventions, but a regression, back to the era of lizard domination and skyrocketing temperatures (timely eh?), man on the run in the jungle as prey rather than at the top of the food chain. Still, he keeps some of his trademark core here- regardless of the direction evolution heads, man's fundamental instinct is self destruction and confusion, as illustrated by our protagonist's unclear attempted suicide/accident buried in the planetarium swamp. Was his attempt at self termination intentional or not? It's a question that permeates the book for a number of chapters, and one that faces humanity as a whole as we head to environmental catastrophe that mirrors the one in The Drowned World.<br/><br/>From a stylistic perspective, interesting to see how decidedly linear and non-experimental the plot is compared to the far more episodic narratives of Crash and Atrocity, and how much Ballard is pulling from Conrad, which is ever present but is far less buried (we even have our Colonel Kurtz!)","day_read": "2022/05/09"},"gravity’s_rainbow": {"title": "Gravity’s Rainbow", "author": "Thomas Pynchon", "stars": "5", "review": "Brilliant, frustrating, all things all at once, simultaneously sad to leave it behind and excited to put it aside and not look at for years. Casts aside any semblance of resolution or linear plot to follow in favor of randomness, a Poisson distribution of bomb locations that decides whether you live or die, and the paranoia of not knowing whether you're next, not knowing whether They are closing in on you and your journey is over and you'll be left castrated and broken. Perhaps the archetypical postmodern novel, a World War II epic where all historical significance is stripped out, all gravitas of the deaths of millions is excluded, there's no moral at the end of the day, no heroic political figure to cast in brilliant light, just 400 characters groping for pleasure and purpose in the midst of broader historical movements beyond their understanding.<br/>If there's a main thing Gravity's Rainbow seems to be circling, its World War II and its place as the culmination of both technological advancement and the expansion of the modern security state. As far as there is a plot, it is a quest by many different forces to understand and capture the German V-2 rocket, which our 'main' character Tyrone Slothrop is connected to by the locations of his hookups and which other forces hold as a mystical deity. The V-2 brings soundless and sightless Death, it advancing so fast that its victims can not possibly hear it until they are already dead. Meanwhile the security agencies, and particularly the OSS (the precursor to the CIA) is lurking in every corner, conducting experiments on children and adults alike, lurking behind every corner, always in wait to swallow you up and disappear you (or your children, or your lover) from the world without a trace. Both combine to overwhelm the characters, to lean on mystical simplifications or be unable to parse signal from noise, sliding into fantasy or paranoia, the world too complex for anyone to coherent sense of it.<br/>Pynchon's writing is, of course, top tier, drifting seamlessly between characters, finding a brilliant emotional image and exploring it and then moving onto the next one. So many of them can be used to explicate things swirling around the novel; Roger Mexico pissing on Pointsmann's desk and making a joke of a fancy officer dinner perhaps the ultimate encapsulation of a lot of Pynchon's whole deal (scoring a small personal victory over the overwhelming forces that subjugate and control you, but ultimately leaving the world largely unchanged), Byron the never dying lightbulb a sign of a perfect piece of technology too useful and not harmful enough for the world it was born into, forced to go on the run, and Gottfried burning up inside the 00000 rocket, gaping in awe and wonder at the beautiful horrors humanity has unleashed upon the world, his screams unheard and unnoticed, a silent cry and an unknown death in a war and world full of them.<br/>All this, and it also spends an immense amount of time comparing rockets and rainbows to penises. 5 stars.

Poisonville is a factory town, run by a wealthy industrialist who empowered gangsters to shut down the IWW in his town (interestingly, Hammett was an ex-Pinkerton who claimed he was offered 5 grand to murder Little) and now they exist out of his control- his son seems to be trying to blow the whistle on their corruption when he is murdered in what turns out to be the act of spurned ex lover but points to a broader coverup that cannot be turned from even as the original case closes. What follows is a descent for the town into madness, parties turned into shooting galleries, banks robbed in broad daylight, liquor safe houses burst into flames, ending in the only place that it could end when the town's fragile equilibrium is disturbed: nearly all the major players dead, the institutions of police and media discredited, and a detective who finds himself enjoying the chaos he has thrust the town into, even if only for the taste of righteous comeuppance it provided.

Unfortunately, it was not to be, as everything from the atmosphere to the prose takes a dip when the art group shows up, and while it picks back up at the end it still doesn’t reach the sheer unbridled heights of that beginning. That beginning though, is exquisite, seemingly every line something that could be ripped as a quotable, the monstrosity and allure of the Funhole, the destructive harmfulness (and joy) of Nicholas and Nakota’s relationship all rendered in beautiful detail, sentences that stretch on searching for beauty and horror and nearly always finding it. The rest is slightly more workmanlike and buttoned down, although Koja does return to some of those lengths to generate some of the horror of the ending. <br/><br/>The Funhole is partially Rorshach test of what the reader wants to get out of this particular novel. As for me (and given it’s partially how Koja explains it in the end), it seems to be a manifestation of Nicholas’ self-loathing, a destructive force that cannot function without him and gives him the power and uninhibitedness to express and act on his desire to destroy himself and those around hhim and the loathing he has for everything; his not girlfriend girlfriend, artists in his community, their artwork. In his state at the beginning he is stuck in stasis, ripping up his drunkedly written poems, being used by Nakota but too scared to rock the boat to ask for anything of her, working a dead-end job at a video store, drinking heavily every night. The Funhole gives him the impetus for action, but only on his self-destructive tendencies, the push to turn the coiled negative feelings inside himself into something manifested on the outside, starting as a hole in his hand and slowly turning his body into a slick inhuman skin that throws itself into nearly certain death. There is a lot of Freud/Lacan here, the death drive manifested as the hole that Nicholas and Nakota are helplessly drawn to without understanding why, the lack of desire represented as a literal black hole in the wall. <br/><br/>It’s unfortunate Koja falls to the trap of seemingly half the novels I’ve read in the last year, of spending time with critiques of artists and how annoying they are, because I think this shaved down and edited slightly heavier in the back half has the chance to be a cornerstone of the genre. But the incessant obnoxiousness of the artists takes away from what is the real star of the show, Nicholas and his journey, and while it’s partially self-inflicted of bringing people around even if you don’t actually want them around, that isn’t really used/leaned into heavily enough by Koja, too focused on criticizing some artist likely long-forgotten to get to the real meat of this book. Still, excited to read more of her at some point in the near future.","day_read": "2021/10/30"},"the_hellbound": {"title": "The Hellbound Heart", "author": "Clive Barker", "stars": "4", "review": "Starting Spooktober 2021 with a classic short novella which Clive Barker eventually turned into the Hellraiser film franchise. <br/><br/>The opening chapter is a masterclass, and had me convinced this was going to be a 5 star banger- a lurid sensory overload full of plenty of disgusting imagery, occultic mystery, and psychosexual implications. The cenobites are left mostly mysterious, the terrors that await Frank much greater than what already witnessed but left to only the reader's devices.<br/><br/>What follows, then, is a slight disappointment, as it moves to more domestic concerns, an unhappy marriage with a wife never satisfied with anything, a friend who pines for her husband but never has the courage to stand up for herself. Even when the horror kicks back, it stays with the character of Frank, a horrifying reconstruction from semen blood spilled by his illicit lover and his quest to stay in the realm of the flesh by any means necessary, rather than the mystical extra-dimensional hedonist monsters. I can see why Barker did it, but I am slightly disappointed given the promise shown in the first chapter. <br/><br/>Barker's main concern seems to be with character's incapability of being satisfied, a never ending quest for more and more pleasure which leads them into contact with these extradimensional beings who's idea of pleasure is so intermingled with suffering as to be indistinguishable. The real treat here though, beyond that central theme, is of the imagery, Frank's sense nightmare, his ejaculate intermingling with spilled blood to form a new being, wearing the skin of his boring bougie brother, the hooks of the cenobites back in him, at last preventing him from making off with his brother's wife and life.<br/><br/>Overall, a classic novella for good reason, and one wouldn't mind revisiting at some point. High 4, and makes me want to rewatch Hellraiser.","day_read": "2021/10/15"},"eugene_onegin": {"title": "Eugene Onegin", "author": "Alexander Pushkin", "stars": "4", "review": "The ruins brought on by youth and manhood, affected world-weariness and cynicism colliding with youthful idealism and pride to ruin and end everyone around them's lives. A testament to the allure and draw of that pride that Pushkin after writing this ended up meeting the same fate as the poet Lemsky- a slight and an advance to his women drawing him into a fatal duel. Our 'hero' is not at all heroic and Pushkin leaves him on his knees, pathetically appealing to the women he once spurned for her hand as she dismisses him cruelly. Pushkin is making an appeal against his world-weariness, against his cynicism against friends and neighbors, against his disregard for his youth and pleasures of life, against his cruel eye casting down on others around them, only able to recognize the beauty of his would-be lover when she is in the hands of another. <br/><br/>The writing obviously suffers from translation, poetry never able to be captured outside of its native tongue, but in general felt like the translation I got did a solid job of capturing some of the original beauty. There are clunky moments, where it feels like it's stretching to match the rhyme scheme, but in general the move to try to capture the original nature of it is a good one (in contrast to other approaches, such as Nabokov's literal translation). Would love to read this in original form, but not sure I have learning Russian on the slate for my next 5 years. Interesting also that the text itself seems to be grappling with the barrier between languages and poetics, in several cases talking about the difficulty of conveying romantic feelings in Russian vs. French. <br/><br/>Pretty good, and we even get Pushkin doing foot guy stuff and then apologizing for it several chapters later. Fun to read this after doing a bunch of other Russians to see where a lot of the archetypes and influences lie. ","day_read": "2021/10/09"},"been_down": {"title": "Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me", "author": "Richard Fariña", "stars": "3", "review": "Richard Farina was a contemporary at Cornell with Thomas Pynchon, and it shows, as there is a lot of what eventually defined Pynchon present here- the long lists placed in the middle of prose, the shadowy conspiracies, and a general humorous irreverence. If you squint hard enough, you even see some Doc Sportello in Gnossus, just aged up 20 years in world-weariness and cynicism.<br/><br/>The who influenced who question of two contemporaries and friends is always fraught, and I can't claim to have read enough to say who is who. However, it is always weird seeing someone put their spin on a style that belongs so distinctly (at least in my memory) to someone else, and I think Farina pales in comparison to what Pynchon eventually went on to do with it. That's not to say they're aren't phenomenal sections of writing in here, whether it be party scenes or Gnossus' apocalyptic vision in Chapter 14, but on the whole it did feel partially like a pale imitation.<br/><br/>This is a college novel to the core, although it owes plenty of its lineage to Kerouac and the Beats as it follows the formula of a semi-autobiographical protagonist stumbling his way through a search for greater enlightenment. Gnossus is Immune and Exempt, both in a literal sense (of exemption from the draft) and in a more spiritual sense (of attempted immunity from politics and the petty concerns of mortal beings). He correctly diagnoses the Ivy league university as where the wealthy go to cosplay at freedom and libertinism, but he is trapped- the straight world is even worse (particularly notable is the vision, which portrays the world outside the campus as literally a fiery nuclear apocalypse of the soul), and a draft that would drag him into a war he does not want to fight loom over him if he escapes the cloistered campus. <br/><br/>His friends are a ragtag group, but far more upright and academic than him, and he soon comes to fall in love with the girl with the knee high green socks, Kristen. The school is in a forming uprising, as the administration is making moves to make it harder to sleep with coeds. Gnossus gets dragged into the mess against his will, and what transpires feels like an eerily prophetic vision of what would become of the counterculture. The girl in the knee high green socks has a father advising the President and is secretly in bed (literally) with the dean of the school, who uses the revolt and a death under suspicious circumstances (important to note this was released 3 years after JFK was assassinated) to take power at the school. The mob is involved somehow. The draconian measures are lifted, but nothing of substance changes in relation between student and university. Our free-spirited Gnossus, wracked by an STD passed by Kristen, is forced onto stage as a political figurehead at the climactic rally- all he can do is throw up two middle fingers, which the crowd of course loves. Once he is no longer useful, and power has been seized, he is quite literally disposed of- Kristen marries the dean, and Gnossus is drafted into the military. <br/><br/>While this all sounds like a tragedy, it plays much more like an absurdist comedy, although the scenes turn disturbing towards the end, of Gnossus' friend, a black student without a family at the school on a scholarship, getting gunned down on a trip to Cuba and an off-putting scene where Gnossus injects Kristen with heroin after her betrayal. (It should be noted that there's also two rather offputting sex scenes in this, one of which would definitely fall under assault today as Gnossus pokes holes in a condom, the other of which was hard to read by today's standards.) Gnossus often plays as obnoxious, and it's hard to read if Farina is doing selfowns or not. He definitely plays into the pure of heart searcher that Beats love to put in, but this portrayal is slightly more ambiguous, as evidenced by some scenes of childish behavior and the many scenes of problematic behavior, and the ending, which feels much more like an end to the travails of the beat and a forced transfer into conformity than the typical Kerouac, which usually ends with the hero temporarily defeated but with the search ready to be renewed in another direction. <br/><br/>There is one scene where I think Farina tips his hand slightly, after Gnossus has a vision of an evil spider monkey stalking him, goes to a friend's house, and tries to calm himself by following thats friend's advice, to envision himself as other parts of a life, as a rock, a stream while his friend tries to find a record of the evil spider monkey in a book of spirits. His friend's wife approaches him, tells him that the friend's on a fool errand, as is trying to envision himself as other- that his problems, and the spider monkey, live inside of him, and that he can only address them himself. For a character full of big grandiose statements and displays of Exemption and rebellion, this doesn't quite register, doesn't quite take, but perhaps Farina is pointing towards something Gnossus could relate to in his view of the college itself- that these countercultural displays were often bourgeois dalliances, flights of fancy, and that the path to genuine authenticity and Exemption from the bullshit of the straight world did not come from those displays but introspection, a change in essence harder to coopt.<br/><br/>Farina died two days after this novel was published, and it's a shame it's all we ever got from him, as I think the grounds for a future great novel. For now, I think this stands as one of the more true depictions of the groundswell of counterculture, one that uses some years of removal from its events for artistic license to form a more meaningful narrative. There's issues here, but definitely worth the read for Pynchon heads/Beat fans.","day_read": "2021/10/02"},"the_ballad": {"title": "The Ballad of Black Tom", "author": "Victor LaValle", "stars": "4", "review": "Short, satisfying novella that flies by in a few afternoons. Does a really good job of recontextualizing Lovecraft's racism by making him a weird little outsider reporting on things he has no knowledge of, of communities he only judges from the outside, while still keeping the actual spirit and thematic interests of cosmic horror present. The central thesis here, that the cosmic destructive indifference of many of Lovecraft's monsters has an appeal to those who society maliciously destroys, is an interesting one, and gives more flavor to the actual narrative plottings than the typical Lovecraft protagonist.  Have some quibbles with the ending, with LaValle falling into the trap that Piranesi and seemingly much of contemporary sci-fi falling into of explaining the ending rather than letting the reader draws conclusions from the (well-drawn) rest of the work, but there's enough here to satisfy. Overall a satisfying and well-done update to Lovecraftian cosmic horror, even as LaValle updates the prose styling to be more modern and far less antiquated and purple. ","day_read": "2021/09/15"},"stonefish": {"title": "Stonefish", "author": "Scott R. Jones", "stars": "5", "review": "Giving a 5 since this needs more reviews/more eyeballs, but in truth probably measures more as a 4. A lot of intriguing stuff here, but not sure the package comes together into a masterpiece yet, but the author has definitely cemented himself as someone to keep eyes on with this genuinely weird piece of science fiction/cosmic horror.<br/>Stonefish is primarily a work of cosmic nihilism, the novel centering around Den Secord’s experience with tech billionaire Georgios Makarios but really around the gods from another world, the archons who appear on Earth as Sasquatch and are the world’s creator and it’s God, humanity just puppets in its game of shit flinging and experimentation. Our two characters are just pawns in their game, their actions preordained and orchestrated to bring them together in the strange woods home of Stonefish. There, they discover the true nature of the Sasquatch, and that the Earth is a simulation run by them to test different outcomes, this one likely a universe where consumption is at the root of every being’s existence, nothing more than a playground for higher gods to mess around in. The only way out of the archons’ sick game is to drop out, to stop the cycle of consumption, to stop consuming and end one’s life, and that is the choice that confronts Den after the revelations at Stonefish. Pretty heavy stuff, but Jones imbues it with enough absurdity and humor to keep this from feeling like something out of Ligotti or something too dour.<br/>One of Jones’ concerns here is artifice, of falsities, of detachment from the real, whether it be in food or in one’s life. Secord rejects the food provided by the archons that tastes like ingredients long removed from the Earth because it is not real, despite the revelation that his world, in a matter of speaking, is not “real.” But in other cases, he is unable to view his world as real anymore- he is unable to connect with his family of sorts after his return from Stonefish, his experience alienating from the relations that he had. Jones seems to be pointing towards a Lovecraftian type deal here- that the real truth of the universe is such that, if it doesn’t drive you mad, it makes fitting in society impossible, the revelations too shaking. It is not possible to reintegrate, to ground ones self in the real, once that curtain has been pulled. An interesting detour, and another aspect of this, is what the archons consider to be real, what can be latched onto when they bring on what is called the Numpty, an ecological event that blacks out sight and feeling from the world, with the exception of the things that humans have imbued with meaning (in this case, a tree that Makarios has trimmed in honor of his son, who may or may not have been real?). There seems to be a kernel of thought there, that our anchors in a world full of artifice and untruth are not our technology or even basic facts about reality, but about our labors of love, our capacity for creation in the world, the concrete things and people we have attached the meaning of our lives to.<br/>Jones does a good job of threading in the world-building here, very similar to some Phillip K Dick type stuff where enough information is given to make the world feel alien but not enough that the reader’s imagination is stifled, and the horror sequences that are present are unsettling in an off-kilter way, rather than a traditional scare method. The climate change ravaged world and the Internet taking over relations between people doesn’t feel hack or forced because it’s not Jones’ focus, just dressing on the side, details to fill out the world. If I have an issue with Stonefish, it’s the slipping into internet parlance (there’s occasional references to memes, and to ones that are old at the present day, let alone in the future time period this takes place in) both in prose and dialogue that feels out of place for some of the subject matter, and perhaps some structural issues, as this does feel like it may wrap up just slightly too quickly for my tastes.<br/>Overall, a quite enjoyable book, and an author (and a publisher) to keep an eye on. Think the best is yet to come for this author.","day_read": "2021/09/06"},"the_master": {"title": "The Master and Margarita", "author": "Mikhail Bulgakov", "stars": "4", "review": "Think I'm a little cooler on this than most, as I found parts of the first book of this to be a tad too caught up in Bulgakov's beefs with the Russian authorities to the point of overindulgence. If I was a Russian in the 30s or even the 60s, I might find this more meaningful, but as it was in the present day it started to drag in parts. There are parts in this half that had me enthralled (namely the magic scene at the theater and the entire opening confrontation between Belioz/Homeless and Woland), but enough depictions of Satan corrupting the foolish and susceptible Russian literary elite and all the names and corruptions start to run together for me. That's not to say it's bad or boring, but it didn't leave me blown away, which I expected from a book of this stature. <br/><br/>However, the second half of this is genuinely phenomenal, a Faustian bargain stretched to its absolute limit. The great ball scene here is phenomenal, the footnotes helping greatly in describing the evils that Satan has assembled, and the scenes of Margarita escaping the drudgery of her life on the broom and in the forest feel genuinely revelatory. The chaos, limited to a single beheading and mostly landing people into institutions, spills over, into burning down of apartments and high class society haunts followed by a storm of epic proportions swallowing Moscow whole as our titular Master and Margarita escape with their devilish friends. <br/><br/>Thematically, this is a tad all over the place (in a good way), but of course any tale of Satanic corruptions and Faustian bargains is going to start with good and evil. Especially in light of the experiment of the Soviet Union with humanity's better side and the outcomes that pervade the first half of the novel (disappearances, secret police, crowded living spaces and the conflict that comes with them) this adds a fresh spin, as the new managers of humanity's best impulses ended up foolish, corrupted, and had easily by the Satanic influences. Bulgakov feels like he's building to more of a generic anti-authoritarianism rather than any specific political ideology, that man cannot be trusted with power, that the enforcement of authority is violence (as Jesus says in his opening confrontation with Pilate), that the pursuit of power and the desire to wield it is a cowardice, the worst of all vices. The use of Jesus in a godless country is a provocative choice, and in part he is illustrating the struggle of the Soviet Union to replace that grounding influence, to make something new in a secular society that does not rely on an otherworldly other to keep man’s nature under check. Pilate's near eternal regret is the price of this power, the idea of a man caught between the moral choice and the only choice allowed by his profession, just wanting to talk philosophy in the garden with a man he sentences to death. On the other side, there is the side of good, conspicuously absent from modern day Moscow in any form. Margarita, in her devotion to the Master, is the closest we get, eschewing her own wishes in order to alleviate the suffering of one of the damned at the ball, and otherwise wholly devoted to her love. Her arc is interesting, though, as she is not the poor saintly women that we see in other Russian literature (i.e. Crime and Punishment), but something different, a member of upper class society bound in a loveless marriage breaking free of confines for the artist she loves.<br/><br/>The damned at the ball represent an interesting aspect of the work given its similarity to a ball thrown in the residence of the US Ambassador that Bulgakov himself attended. That, combined with the use of foreign currency to condemn members in the first book, the representation of Satan as a tourist, and the destruction of the store of fine things for tourists, show that Bulgakov believes that the people of the Union have been at least in some part betrayed by the influence of foreign money, by the need to acquiesce to foreign interests, and that in part the elite’s ability to be corrupted is because of this relationship with foreign influences. His anger seems to burn hottest for this, a betrayal of the stated project of a nation for outside riches. <br/><br/>The iconic quote of the book is “Manuscripts don’t burn,” and it is a popular Russian novel of this era, so of course this has plenty to say about state suppression and censor. The Master’s destruction of his own work parallels Bulgakov burning his own first manuscript of this novel, and Bulgakov seems to believe the only thing preventing him from institutionalization was his lack of showing it to the world, as the Master is destroyed by the press despite his work never been published. The close here, of The Master completing his novel and finding peace by setting Pilate free of his own torment, feels extremely emotional affecting, that the completion of the work and its merit was not just for publication and outside praise but for the spiritual closure of The Master himself and the one that inspired him in Pilate. The character of Ivan Homeless, perhaps the most featured character that isn’t in the title or Satan, functions as a counterpoint, as the outcome of a writer writing to the market that is provided him. He is a poet at the beginning, one who writes under the name homeless given the nobility of the proletariat, but his brush with Satan and the Master makes him realize his work was meaningless, pointless, and give up the pursuit of poetry altogether. The author is clearly angling at something purer, both artistically and in the experience of living, one free of societal constraints and influence that bind us down in expression even if it is unattainable in our feeble fragile human existences.<br/><br/>Wish I had read some Pushkin and Gogol before this, though, as this is dense as hell with references that mostly flew over my head.

Some interesting parallels between here and Borges' Library of Babel, the labyrinths containing opposites (Babel the sum of all possible knowledge, this one every possible symbol but nothing concrete and real) and the mystery/thriller aspects of the middle are quite intriguing and hard to put down.

I see parts of the Cormac McCarthy comps, but at least my experience of his work feels far less human than we see here- McCarthy seems far more interested in the evildoers, in the devil himself, but while Zahler includes a character that fits that in the model with Quinlan, he's far less interested in exploring him- he doesn't appear on page until late, and Zahler is far more concerned with our four men reckoning with the evil they took part in, not the evil itself. (There's also the fact that Zahler is simple not the prose stylist that McCarthy is, and he doesn't try to be- all of this is rather simple, to the point, which benefits the story he's telling, whereas McCarthy is building on a far more epic scale.)<br/><br/>That's not to say there's no evil here, and the brutality depicted is sufficiently extreme for fans who come to his novels after watching Zahler's exceptionally violent Bone Tomahawk and Brawl in Cell Block 99. Between the flashbacks to Quinlan's actions with our four protagonists and their actions at the wedding, the bloody impulse in me was well satisfied, and it builds a feeling of doom and fear that whatever Quinlan has in store will be extreme for everyone. <br/><br/>The thematic thrust is Zahler's desire to interrogate our main four's past, to determine whether one can ever be absolved for atrocities, if their ability to become a good member of their community, a father, a brother, a church-goer can allow them to escape their past. Can't imagine it's spoilers to say so, but the answer presented is clearly a no- Quinlan and his gang present/represent the past as a grotesque force, never to be escaped, waiting around every corner, for a moment that is meaningful enough to you that it's worth it for them to snatch it away and to wreak chaos on everything you love. The only way out is through noble sacrifice, to stamp out the force you allowed to flourish in your past and then gracefully walk your way to the noose to have your neck stamped. Zahler lays on some of the Jesus imagery a little thick at times, but his reframing it as men going to the metaphorical cross for their own sins in service of their wives and daughters as well as women for the sins of their husbands at least puts an interesting spin on it. <br/><br/>Was most shocked by the human spin Zahler puts on this- don't think he's including any beats that are terribly deep, but from reputation he seemed much more misanthropic. There's a lot of moments in here, before and after the shit hits the fan, that are genuinely emotionally affecting, even if they are simplistic, and I would have figured Zahler wouldn't be interested in such moments, but those are the beats that give the whole the punch it has.","day_read": "2021/06/22"},"babel-17": {"title": "Babel-17", "author": "Samuel R. Delany", "stars": "4", "review": "Read as sort of a test run to see whether the mountain of Dhalgren was worth climbing, and I think Delaney passes the test. Not sure when I'll get to it, but it's on the list for real now. This was either a high 3 or a low 4 and I was feeling generous today. <br/><br/>The genre trappings of this weaken it, at least in my opinion, as a lot of the sci fi dressing of it doesn't add up to a whole helluva lot in theme or really even in plotting that couldn't be achieved through a more grounded environment. Some of it feels worthwhile, or is at least fun, but other aspects just feel like padding to get this to fit into certain genre conventions. <br/><br/>The ideas here are good ones though, as Delaney uses the sci-fi setting to poke at his ideas of linguistics, and namely the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (which is perhaps more popular now due to Ted Chaing and the movie Arrival; Delaney, for what it's worth, believed it at the time of publication but grew to discard for more complex theories as he aged.) You can feel him feeling out for all its worth, both in the character moments and in the world- one particular treaty agreement mentioned includes a nice Delaney explainer on how to explain 'home' to a culture and a language that has no conception of it due to their reproductive functionings. The character of Rydra Wong is his primary vessel for exploration, her switching in and out of the foreign language Babel-17 to allow her to break down complex systems because of its linguistic efficiency, but the alien nature of the language also taking root in her brain, altering her own actions without her conscious awareness of it. He also hints at the ability to speak and understand multiple languages on a deeper level as a form of telepathy, one that gives greater understanding of human thought and feeling on even a subconscious level. The character of Butcher is Delaney's other vessel for exploring it, a man with the conception of the self stripped out of him (no concept of 'I' or 'you'), leading to some grappling with the source of empathy, the source of our ability to understand the implication of our actions. It's all pretty heady stuff to put into a short book, but it for the most part comes off, with the help of Delaney's willingness to explain things directly in detail and his otherwise efficient but effective prose.","day_read": "2021/06/10"},"the_three": {"title": "The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch", "author": "Philip K. Dick", "stars": "4", "review": "Starts as kinda bland futuristic corporate drama with some present day parallels and then melds itself into something for more interesting, a meditation on God, drugs, and corporate power. Wouldn’t be lying if I said the first portion bored me a little bit, but once this thing gets heated up it’s excellent. <br/><br/>The prose here is a little lackluster, as it is Ubik, although like the rest of things it picks up as things progress. In the second half Dick is almost entirely in gonzo weird ideas mode, with potentially diverging timelines, dreams inside of dreams, and other fuckery to make the reader wonder if anything they just read made any sense. The commitment to the ideas is what makes the prose shine, as you can feel Dick’s interest and sophistication increase as he gets into what really is the meat of the novel.<br/><br/>There’s a few different metaphors at work here, mainly in the drugs presented: Can-D and Chew-Z. There’s somewhat of an initial argument about community vs. individualism, as Can-D requires its users to share the hallucination space, to act as one unit in one hallucinated body on Earth, while Chew-Z is a solitary drug, one that allows the user to spend infinite time in a dreamscape catered to their own interests and needs in the blink of an eye. This is all undercut by the fact that the Chew-Z is not really run by the user, but by Palmer Eldritch, the corporate master selling Chew-Z (or at least an alien occupying Palmer Eldritch). The users of Chew-Z filter their imaginations, their dreams through the drug, a powerful metaphor that can stand in for a variety of factors- mass media, social media, ideology, corporate control over art, but in any case serves as a powerful warning to not let these forces control our imaginations, to not let them serve as a filter for our dreams or to use them as an escape from our own earthly problems. Eldritch begins to infect the vision of takers of the drug, appearing as their friends, their family, another indictment of anything with mass control over people that prevents them from seeing the world properly. The dissatisfaction the Mars colonists feel with the Can-D is in part due to their conditions- they labor with no control over their situation, with no hope of escape, and no hope of really succeeding in their labor. The drug is their only escape from a life of drudgery and purposelessness, which ultimately undercuts the community experience inhabiting the hallucination space. <br/><br/>With Palmer Eldritch’s power, there comes the question of Gods and eternal life and the meaning of it. Chew-Z presents the opportunity for eternal life, for humans to never die- does this make him God, or at least, a god? The meaning of this eternal life is also at question, given human’s lack of control over it, given the possible malign influence of Eldritch forever lurking in the shadows of the dream. The novel ends with a possible victory, that humanity has murdered the actual Eldritch and lives in peace, but the visions and his ability to conjure this reality leaves the reader questioning whether this isn’t another hallucination. <br/><br/>Mayorson’s character is the one I found mostly compelling, a man broken by his own cowardice, his own decisions, fighting with whether to return to the hallucinations presented of a possible alternate past or future or return to the reality that he left in shambles for himself. His return to the hallucinations representing the opportunity for Eldritch to serve an attack and continue his mind colonization of the human race is a powerful example of the dangers of escape into these all-consuming filters, be it television or the Internet. The women here are really only partially formed sketches, and the tech CEO isn’t much of a character to me, but as is typical for Dick, the ideas are at the center. <br/><br/>My favorite of the more narrative bending Dicks between this and Ubik, really enjoyed this quite a bit once it got moving.","day_read": "2021/05/30"},"songs_of": {"title": "Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe", "author": "Thomas Ligotti", "stars": "4", "review": "Definitely something I wish I had chewed on slower and broken up rather than something I tried to read like a novel in one go. Loved many parts of this but it is a lot when stacked all together, not just in length but in terms of the level of effort that Ligotti demands from you in each story. <br/><br/>But when it works it's all worth the demand, as Ligotti even here in a formative state has a gift for creeping dread and a horror that surpasses our understanding (some of it leans into Lovecraftian territory, sans the racism). The spaces Ligotti writes are in decay, often with a Rust Belt sensibility of the horrors of deindustrialization and aging made literal. His prose is often the highlight rather than any particular plot movement, creating a sense of dread suggested by the circumstances rather than a literary jump scare of a monster waiting at the end of the tunnel, and it leads to stories that creep under you skin rather than any visceral response. I've heard it only gets better from here, so excited to continue into the Ligottiverse. <br/><br/>Ligotti seems to be primarily interested in two horrors, the first of which is loss of control, that our consciousness' control over our bodies is a fragile thing. To illustrate this Ligotti uses dolls and mannequins frequently, creepy facsimiles that characters are turned into, their minds trapped in a prison with no externalization. In parts this becomes a metaphor for the power the rich exert over the poor, as in 'The Chymist'; in others, it becomes something more personal, of being manipulated at work, as in 'Dream of a Manikin.' The other seems to be the idea that our present world is a veil, a collective illusion/delusion, with something much more evil and menacing lying beneath it. Ligotti's anti-human stance is clear here, the idea that any sort of pleasantness is something that society conspires to create, and that lying just beneath are horrors we can't imagine, that only a few have the eyes to see but all live under, shows the sort of contempt he has for humanity at large, for the structures we have built that hide the grotesque realities of our day to day existence.<br/><br/>Overall, an exciting opening collection, and excited to see where he goes from here, as I've heard it's only up hill from here.","day_read": "2021/05/26"},"to_the": {"title": "To the Lighthouse", "author": "Virginia Woolf", "stars": "4", "review": "Probably the most accessible of the Woolf I've read so far (The Waves and Mrs. Dalloway being the others), but probably my least favorite of the bunch as well. That's not to say that I didn't very much like this book, but it didn't inspire the love I have for the other two. Likely a 5 for any other author, but there’s some degree of grading on a curve here. Will probably become the Woolf I recommend to people.<br/><br/>That being said, this still blows the doors off 99% of other writing, contemporary or classic. Woolf on a sentence level is in a different class from basically every other writer, even as she's in a much more restrained mode here. The narrative, scant though it is, is traceable, partially because much of the book takes place over two days, rather than the epic scale of The Waves. Dialogue, chapters, characters responding to each other directly in time are all here, which make it much easier to latch onto than the pure stream of consciousness of The Waves. There’s still plenty of long sentences and internal thoughts here, and Woolf proves herself to be one of the best at one of writing’s preeminent no-nos, the switching of perspectives inside a chapter. The dinner scene particularly is exceptional, capturing unspoken gestures and restrained thoughts from seemingly every perspective at a long dinner table, but nowhere leaves the reader confused on who they are seeing inside of.<br/><br/>What I love about Woolf is she’s capable of blowing up the personal and the interpersonal to the same epic scale as novelists that tackle societal forces or changes or politics. Here is no different, as she tackles on a host of different subjects in various forms and ways. To The Lighthouse seems most focused on the various forces that divide people from each other.<br/><br/>Perhaps most prominent among those is the concept of gender roles and how they make relationships between any set of individuals difficult. The men in this novel are by and large extremely narcissistic and self-important; the father Mr. Ramsey excessively worried about his own legacy, whether he will be remembered, and committed to the idea of the truth rather than any form of emotional harmony. Charles Tansley is incapable of having a conversation about anything other than himself; others are reclusive, not desiring social ties in favor of wanting to lock themselves up and work. The women are constrained and put down; Mrs. Ramsey by the insecurities of her husband, Lily Briscoe by the scores of people telling her that she can’t create, that she must marry. Mrs. Ramsey is a busybody, incapable of letting a moment sit, worry pressing at her at all times, a body needing motion. She also is a much more old-fashioned view of femininity, the mother to countless children, the patient wife, while Lily is a new model, eschewing a husband in pursuit of a husband. All these personality quirks, largely attributable to society’s expectations on these people rather than purely intrinsic instincts, serve to separate them, to annoy each other and prevent from genuine and honest emotional approach to each other. Towards the end, Woolf uses the metaphor of a wagon wheel running over a foot to illustrate this- is it the wheel’s fault for running over the foot? Or was the wheel put on a track it could not deviate from? <br/><br/>Also apparent here is the metaphor of the lighthouse. In the first section it stays a mythical destination, a landmark to be reached for, just out of reach for the young children. In the closing section, they finally reach the destination, and it becomes much more mundane, an artifact rusting and decaying like any else. This applies well to the characters in their dualities as well, Mr. Ramsey the tyrant of the family and the weak, fragile man just trying to connect, Mrs. Ramsey the loving mother and beauty who can’t tell her husband she loves him. All of these characters embody contradictions between these two perceptions, and there are often contradictions in how others perceive them as well. Frequently, characters flip from thoughts of hating someone fervently to thoughts of tenderness and affection in the span of a paragraph or two. These contradictory feelings can be what separate people from each other, but they are also what enable us to connect with those that momentarily irritate us or have done us harm, and Woolf takes those into account in building every stray thought of the characters throughout. <br/><br/>The middle section does feature some textbook Woolf experimentation, as she spans a decade of time with only descriptions of a house in decay and parentheticals of tragedies befalling the Ramsey family. This section is notable for how blunt and crashing the tragedies come down, especially from her- for her to kill off major characters in a parenthetical short sentence feels more stark because of the lengths she just spent on a single day. The house is revitalized; the family returns, and their relationships in some ways seem to heal with the house.<br/><br/>The final section, the day of that return, with the trip to the lighthouse coming, and a family in resentment to each other, is marvelously done. The children soften to their father, and their father at least partially opens himself to them; Lily Briscoe goes back to her painting interrupted a decade prior. Woolf uses the painting as a vessel for delving into the inadequacy of art, and really of our feelings/emotions for processing the human experience. Only 10 years on can she come to grips with her relationship to and the death of Mrs. Ramsey, time being necessary to accomplish so. The painting, when finished, is not perfect, does not capture everything she wants it to capture or everything feels. But it is Lily’s best attempt, and that seems to be the closing mission statement (particularly since this is at least partially autobiographical): art as a means to expressing, accessing, and understanding one’s emotions, our flailing attempts at meaning and purpose and comprehension of the lives we lead and the relationships we share with others, no matter how incomplete it may be, no matter how it may be perceived by others (a clear rebuttal to Mr. Ramsey’s gnawing thoughts about the life of his work after death). It is our attempt to capture each other, on both sides of the lighthouse, both in the myths and best qualities we see in each other and in the ugly mundane inadequacies resentments desperately trying to be hidden but nakedely plain to the eye.","day_read": "2021/05/04"},"the_name": {"title": "The Name of the Rose", "author": "Umberto Eco", "stars": "5", "review": "Waffled between the 4 and the 5 but the ending got me to the 5. Read the first probably 100 or so pages of this deep on pain medication, so thoughts may not be as deep as usual. Or at least blame it on that if you think it sucks. Still not sure how this 500+ page deeply Catholic novel is one of the best selling novels of all-time but what do I know.<br/><br/>A book unapologetically up his own ass, The Name of the Rose spends it first 100 pages alienating the reader, intentionally. There’s fun to be had, but it is absolutely a writer on his bullshit- Eco spends what feels like 25 pages (read on Kindle, so not sure the exact quantity) describing the young monk Adso’s reaction to a towering piece of art in the monastery and another lengthy portion on how the mentor William guessed the name of an escaped horse. Not the most engaging or enthralling stuff, but it helps you get on the book’s wavelength: this is a murder mystery, but not one that is trying to string you along with easy to find clues or plot details, one that is very concerned with the world it takes place in and the debates of the time<br/><br/>The book is also at an important crossroads of the Catholic Church, where the debate over the poverty of Christ is actively being debated, heresy is running rampant, and the state is beginning to rebel against the Church’s authority over secular life. The witch hunt is beginning its use as a source of social control, and the church for the first time in a long time is having to fight for its preeminent place in European society. These debates are not just woven into the plot action or the dialogue between characters, but behind themes.<br/> At its core this novel asks questions about knowledge and power: who does it belong to, and more importantly to whom should it belong? The anti-poverty segment of the church, the monastery that is playing host, clearly sits on one side: that wealth belongs to the church, that these trinkets glorify God, and that knowledge should be carefully managed and restricted to only those with the training and prestige for it. The Franciscan segment believes wealth belongs to the world, and that the church should be poor, serving the poor, and staying out of secular matters. Their views on sharing of old books is more opaque, but as far less hierarchical organization, it’s easy enough to imagine their views. The question of the Church’s role clearly plays a role in the next, oh, 500 years or so European history, so the debates here are historically relevant and a view into the forces that decided much of the world as we know it. <br/><br/>In the end, the resolution gives us Eco’s take- that the concentration of power and knowledge in the hallowed halls rather than amongst the people necessitates violence to preserve its status, as seen through Burgos’ murders to keep Aristotle’s legendary book on laughter out of the hands of the monks. The “protection” of knowledge ultimately quite literally burns the library, and the monastery itself, down, a perhaps not so subtle allusion to the Church burning much of its influence in its cloistered nature and grabs for power. Burgos’ final villainous monologue also proves that these debates aren’t meaningless theology, or debate for debate’s sake: these debates prove the basis for the Church’s power, and their loss would lead to the diminishment of the Church’s influence. This book, according to Burgos, would give intellectual heft and weight to laughter, the lowest of human emotions (according to him), and in doing so give power to the lower classes, to the common man and woman, as well as undermining the tool of the Church for social control, fear. If that occurs, what is the use of intellectual monks and the institution of the Church, who gain power through their interpretation skills, if knowledge and wisdom belong to the common man? From the exaltation of laughter there is a straight line to power residing in the people’s hands. <br/><br/>Eco’s approach to the mystery is quite postmodern; even as our detective manages to logic himself into a solution, he often does so by moments of inspiration rather than a sustained line of thought, and the steps that led him to the solution are shown to be flawed in the last moment of revelation. The belief in a grand narrative of the killings, that they matched a biblical prophecy, led him astray even as his deductions based on that led him in the right direction. As a matter of fact, his belief in this grand narrative is weaponized by the murderer himself, who continues to follow the pattern to obfuscate his identity and intentions. That this is true and instructive in the age of misinformation and conspiracy theories that provide simplistic solutions to the grander problems of the world (be it Q Anon or Russian election interference conspiracies) hardly seems to need to be said. These narratives distract us from the uglier, mundane truth of power grabs and naked disgusting human ambition and evil that often contradicts and opposes itself. That this death to the grand narrative implicates the nonexistence of God is not ignored by the text, either- our noble hero William seems to concede that he cannot reconcile God with the chaos of the world, but he must carry on in the Church so that he can safely express himself. But Eco’s disbelief in the grand narrative does not mean it is useless- as a matter of fact, he finds that they can be used for temporary purposes but ultimately necessary to be discarded. William puts it as such:   “You must throw the ladder away, because you discover that, even if it was useful, it was meaningless.”<br/><br/>Beyond the philosophical implications and the history, there is plenty of other literary pleasures to be found here, including Eco’s labyrinth he plants in the library (the not so subtle nod to Borges in Burgos telegraphs the influence), Adso’s one night stand with a village girl and subsequent ecstasy and regret, and plenty of Eco humorously poking at the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church. Once the first 100 pages are conquered, this actually becomes quite an accessible mystery, with plenty of character, mystery, and philosophical digression to keep the reader hooked.<br/><br/>For the record, Jesus laughed.","day_read": "2021/04/16"},"caliban_and": {"title": "Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation", "author": "Silvia Federici", "stars": "5", "review": "The world we live is not natural; it was made. It is a simple truth, but one difficult to internalize and allow to seep into your thought processes. But this thought is at the core of being able to conceive of a world better than the one we live in. <br/><br/>What this book does, then, is take you back to the start, to the pre-capitalist world to find the origins of our present condition, so we can see that things are not rooted in natural forces but were constructed for a specific reason. Federici is mainly concerned with the way misogyny, and especially the witch hunt, was weaponized as a way for mostly male workers to accept the loss of the commons to the ruling class, which was the primary incident in the creation of capitalism.<br/><br/>The argument is this: the process of primitive accumulation (i.e, the consolidation of land and capital into the ruling class’ hands) required the seizure of the land previously held in common by the workers that they used as their livelihood. What came for them in replacement was the advent of waged labor. Workers were, of course, infuriated by their land being taken from them, so the ruling class managed a compromise: the public ownership of land was replaced by the public ownership of women’s bodies, and by making the only labor they could perform reproducing. With this comes a whole host of repressive changes: women being forced out of the workplace (ensuring dependance on men, leading to abuse and degradation), the destruction of contraceptive methods and other healing methods passed down through generations, and, of course, the witch hunt. The witch hunt was an attack on woman’s autonomy, on their bodies; the state dropped all pretense of “causing harm” on the part of the accused witches and attacked anyone outside the bounds of the newly imposed order, primarily as a means of founding the new social order. Women did not take this lying down, but their rebellions lacked the support necessary to overcome, and the threat of excruciating torture, rape, and execution made any resistance risky to muster and doomed to ultimately fail. <br/><br/>The book also looks for the justifications and the reasoning behind the changes. Mercantilism held that the strength of a country was based almost exclusively in the amount of labor power it had, so reproduction must be incentivized at all costs. This leads to many of the changes mentioned above, such as the removal of woman from the workforce and their lack of autonomy, the destruction of contraception, as well as other changes, such as the stigmatization and punishment of homosexuality. At the same time, conceptions of the body that interacted with the emerging capitalist thought saw the body as mechanical, just a tool that needed to be adjusted right to be a labor machine. To get the workforce in a position to be this perfectly honed tool, all elements of spirituality, of frivolity, needed to be stripped, which includes the spiritual practices often associated with witches but also sex for the purpose of pleasure and ultimately friendships and communal relations.<br/><br/>Federici uses the present to show how the process of primitive accumulation has not stopped. In India and in Africa, the witch hunt persists even as the Anglo world has moved on, a sign those societies are being exploited by the West with little recourse other than violence against their own people. The countries themselves may no longer be explicitly colonized and occupied, but the scar tissue of years of control lives on in their culture.<br/><br/>While it details the changes that were made, it also details the conditions beforehand, which were almost always across the board better for women. They could take part in the commons and be self sufficient, they were allowed in various guilds and to be part of the workforce, their friendships with other women were not treated as suspicious, and they had far more bodily autonomy with regards to reproduction. Their lives were not perfect, and misogyny was still present, but the transition from feudalism to capitalist production hit them the hardest and they paid the largest price for it. Their treatment, from the witch hunt to now, is not something natural to the human condition, but something constructed, just as other prejudices are, to divide the working class from itself, to prevent them from realizing the true enemy. <br/><br/>The present condition is not some fundamental part of our nature, not intrinsic to who we are as creatures. Society can be molded, can be shaped in the image of those who choose to do so. What this book does is lift the hood over this image and reveal the work and the act of creation behind it. A must-read if you’re interested in politics or feminism in my opinion.<br/><br/>(Federici has made an apparent TERF turn in recent years, so perhaps better to check this book out at the library rather than give her your money, but this still is worth reading IMO)","day_read": "2021/04/10"},"ready_player": {"title": "Ready Player Two (Ready Player One, #2)", "author": "Ernest Cline", "stars": "1", "review": "Don't have too much to say about this one that I didn't say about its predecessor, but rest assured, this is somehow even worse than Ready Player One.<br/><br/>I may have had my problems with RP1, but at least there was a vision in it, a driving purpose to it, something that felt like its creator was remotely passionate about. It may have been an artless vision, but there was passion and drive behind it, something that even as I despised much of the content I couldn't help but at least get partially swept up in. This feels more like a cash grab, like Cline's heart is no longer in it, the plot roughly a copy and paste of the first one with some slight variations so it doesn't feel exactly the same. I thought I read somewhere that Cline wrote this in order to make the sequel to the movie happen, and it feels like it. <br/><br/>Some of the criticisms of RP1 as white dude fantasy clearly have rubbed off on our author, as there are plenty of plays at the language of social justice, including critiques of John Hughes movies as lily-white, the addition of a trans woman as a character, and a takedown of the founder character of Halliday as a manipulative misogynist. Unfortunately, these for the most part feel tacked on and forced in, something Cline thought he should put in rather than something he felt wholeheartedly committed to. There's also plenty of signs that for all the effort he's put in to make this feel more inclusive, he hasn't really internalized any of it. Wade secretly stalks his ex-girlfriend in the OASIS after she's broken up with him and is never really made to pay for it or even feel bad about it; instead, he says that watching an orgy porno is much grosser than that, and as a matter of fact stalking her is far better than doing that. I don't need to point out the issue here, do I? <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/>The end of this is a revelation that we've invented a way to bring back the dead, that we can take their consciousness and upload it to the OASIS and live on forever. It's clear that this is a distinct consciousness from its originator, that is indeed a copy rather than a direct port of someone's consciousness (i.e., not like San Junipero from Black Mirror; there's a copy of Wade living at the same time as actual Wade). Not to get theological here, but there's no question of a soul, of the life itself carrying on- we are all reducible to just the combination of traits we have, to our favorite TV shows and movies, to the way we happen to express ourselves. It's no wonder someone that has such a disdain for humanity as Cline would see it this way, but it's a depressing vision, one lacking an appreciation for people, for the unique life that lies beneath, for what we are beyond just our conscious brains, beyond what can be quantified and programmed. Our author predictably has no thoughts of any of this, as no question of that lives inside of the novel itself.<br/><br/>I'll close this on a quote from the villain of the book, who criticizes the two books far more succinctly than I could: <br/><br/>'Don't you kids ever get tired of picking through the wreckage of a past generation's nostalgia? I mean, look around. The entire OASIS is like one giant graveyard, haunted by the undead pop-culture icons of a bygone era. A crazy old man's shrine to a bunch of pointless crap.'<br/>","day_read": "2021/03/28"},"the_king": {"title": "The King in Yellow", "author": "Robert W. Chambers", "stars": "4", "review": "Read in part because True Detective Season 1 is the only good television ever made and in part to dive deeper into the history of weird fiction. Didn't know exactly what I was getting into and was relatively stunned to find this was only half weird/horror and the rest a much more traditional literary collection, but found things to love in either end.<br/><br/>HP Lovecraft did not invent the 'I'm totally sane, you can trust me' protagonist, apparently, as the opening story features a guy who was kicked in the horse and sent to the asylum but it was all an error, really, and the rest of the first four stories feature varying degrees of protagonists detailing their own descent into madness. If it were me I would simply not read The King In Yellow and go crazy. Lovecraft is pilfering plenty else here for his own use, which makes for interesting parallels. For writing when he did, ~30 years before Lovecraft, Chambers prose feels more modern, more accessible, but still retains a tinge of the old-timey verbiage and style that helps add to the atmosphere of Lovecraft's best works.<br/><br/>The King in Yellow, an in universe text as well as the title of this collection,  hangs over these first four stories, and really the rest of it that does not directly invoke it, a book that drives the reader insane upon reading it, one that brings other worlds, other dimensions into our own realm. The idea of a work driving people mad is not unfamiliar- Infinite Jest features a similar conceit, and anyone who has parents knows the horrors of hearing them talk about 'what they've been reading on Facebook.' This idea can be applied to any variety of texts that bring about real-world terror, whether it be FoxNews or QAnon conspiracy posts or 4Chan edgelord. What Chambers does here, through the first person narration, is capture the appeal to the enraptured while putting you in the outside perspective, the watcher of a friend, a family member driven to these awful lengths. The appeal he captures is many fold through these stories- the promise of power, the appeal of transgression, the feeling of being part of something larger, the fear of a cruel world and mysterious strangers, the desire to reconnect with the lost and dead. The book itself is mysterious, appearing on bookshelves unannounced, unplaced by its owners, attacking those at their weakest and most vulnerable, just like those conspiracies do today. It all makes for a simple, well-crafted metaphor, even if it's not the only thing at play with the horror here, as much of the delight here comes from the supernatural imagery of Carcosa and the masks and the Yellow King and the uncertainty that Chambers leaves in the text with these crazed narrators. <br/><br/>Chambers is writing from the perspective of the 1890s syphillis outbreak in Paris, so it's easy to see what inspired the shorts, but in this construction he transcends them, makes them timeless. There are other tales here too, tales of the dead reaching to the living, transcending time continuums, as well as tales of coming of age in Paris, tales much more of innocence than anything else. Chambers is an American who lived in Paris between his age 21 and 28, and it's easy to see this as a tribute to his time there- the tales of innocence a memorial of his first years in Paris, innocent and falling in love with French girls, the weird tales at the front the tales of the fallout of the free sex of that time. The former is the weak point of the collection and obviously less interesting, but still worthwhile nonetheless. One of my favorite shorts that doesn't fit neatly with the rest is 'The Street of the First Shell'- Chambers atmospheric horror taken to the battlefield creates a waking nightmare that captures the disorientation and chaos of the battlefield in ways that don't come naturally to actual war writers. <br/>","day_read": "2021/03/17"},"my_year": {"title": "My Year of Rest and Relaxation", "author": "Ottessa Moshfegh", "stars": "4", "review": "Another nearly plotless book in the bag, and also another unnamed woman at its center. Really making me stretch my use of the word 'the narrator,' contemporary literature. Reading this after Ducks, Newburyport was like a breath of fresh air simply for having dialogue and sentences- can only imagine what a pulp novel would do for me at the moment. <br/><br/>Engaging with depression in a novel is difficult because depression, at least as I experience it, is largely boredom. Boredom is self-evidently boring and thus not good fodder for a novel- even though I loved The Pale King, the only novel I'm aware of that even attempts to tackle boredom, I would hesitate to call it entertaining. Moshfegh shortcuts around the boringness of depression by turning this into a farce, the characters overly exaggerated versions of real types of people, their antics giving the entertainment value to get you to sit through 300 pages of depression and anhedonia. Criticisms of these characters as unrealistic strike me as missing the point entirely- you might not like them, and you might find this book off-putting, but if your issue is with the lack of realism than your issue is with the premise and not the execution. <br/><br/>As for its depiction of depression, I found little to fault. I think it captures the headspace of the depressed individual accurately in exaggerated form- the contempt for people trying to be helpful, seeing any attempts at happiness or self-improvement or anything other than wallowing as corny, the desire for closeness with other people while shoving them away when they draw near, the lack of feeling and caring that accompanies you at every stage of your life. The central metaphor of sorts here, what is being literalized in painstaking detail, is that emerging from a deep depression is like waking up from a slumber even if it isn't a literal one, a sequence of days that all feel the same, just ticks on a calendar, and craving the release of unconsciousness whenever you can get one. The person that wakes up (if they can) in many ways does not resemble the one slumbering, their way of seeing and engaging with the world replaced with something new, looking through the world with fresh eyes. The prose, sedate and hemmed-in for much of the runtime, sparkles when she emerges, the feeling of taking in the world with new eyes literalized, the intake of sensory detail suddenly captivating, our friends people we see with sympathy and care even if we recognize their inadequacies. <br/><br/>There's clearly a duality dynamic between the narrator and Reva. The narrator represents what I would consider to be more of the stereotypical zoomer approach to depression/mental illness, obsessed with dissociating and prescription pills and just escaping one's own head to circumvent mental illness. Reva is the flipside of the coin, what I would consider the more millennial mindset caricature, trying to bootstrap your depression, that the key to the happiness is this life hack and getting into shape and embracing 'adulting' and this self-help book called something like 'Dig The Shit Out of Your Ass: How to Fix Your Brain And Win.' Neither is happy and neither is to be admired, and the book is clearly poking fun at them, but I think it does a good job at keeping them relatively sympathetic (or at least Reva sympathetic) even as it laughs at their foibles. Moshfegh is intent on making you understand that their issues are their own but they are coming out of larger forces, whether it be parental relationships and loss or the body expectations placed on women (especially in the year 2000). It is important in the end that our narrator wakes up and chooses to engage with the world, that the haze of pills and detachment from society is a temporary measure. The world does not change around her metamorphosis, but her view of it does- she tells her friend 'I love you' first (her friend doing to her a recurring line earlier) even though none of Reva's underlying issues and annoying habits have changed, she sees people out in public in a different light, etc. <br/><br/>If there's a third side to the coin, it's Dr. Tuttle, the pill-slinging psychologist. She's almost entirely a source of comedy, a reflection of mental health treatment that prescribes medication at every opportunity and cares little for the patient, never pushing back on their desires and not  remembering anything about them other than what they pick up from the pharmacist when they leave the office.<br/><br/>People have expanded the scope of this novel to be a critique of millennials or millennial culture, which I don't think is unfounded. But while the critique is rather pointed, I don't think it lacks empathy or sympathy for the characters involved- it just wants them to choose better mindsets and habits, one that avoid the pitfalls of the diseased and decaying society that raised them and formed them into what they are.<br/><br/>Still trying to sort out the ending in my head. Ending on a 9/11 is an edgy provocation and a payoff on some blatant foreshadowing, but what does it actually mean? Is it adding shock value to try to grab attention? This story plays with art and shock value plenty- the artist Ping Xi grabs attention by doing things like freezing dogs and painting with his ejaculate, and while the narrator thinks negatively about it, he is the outside force that enables our narrator to complete her experiment. If it's just provocation, then I guess I can live with that and find it interesting from an author's standpoint, but it doesn't fit the book. Is it a sign that behind the new lease our narrator has on life, she's still the selfish person underneath, nothing really changing underneath? She is using a tragedy as a contextualization for her own personal journey, and the author clearly has a bit of distance/dislike for the narrator and it wouldn't be out of tone to undercut the entire chapter before of her new lease on life. Or it could be undermining the utility of her feelings, that even if she feels better, it doesn't mean the way she treats other people and the way she affects them doesn't change. Is it just a reflection on the coping mechanisms that develop out of recovery from depression, that the moments and thoughts we ascribe meaning to, the ones that are enable us to survive and engage with the world may be fucked up and selfish but ultimately necessary? That ones rings as the most charitable interpretation, but the 9/11 aspect is so quickly tossed in (it's a page-long chapter that covers the event itself and her emotional response to it) that if that's the case, it certainly doesn't feel properly developed. Whatever the case, I think it's more interesting that I think it is good. Seen a lot of people lavish praise on this aspect and I am really curious what they think it means beyond the spectacle of it because I'd be shocked if it didn't at least give people pause.<br/><br/>There's plenty else here- a lot on grief, grieving people that you know you shouldn't, and a lot about the act of creation and the meaning of art. There's also plenty of easy criticisms to place on this, namely that at the end of the day who really cares if a trust fund baby is miserable when she never has to work a day for the life. But I think there's more to the class character here than what it lets on- for one, it makes a year of rest and relaxation possible; for two, I think it helps the isolating of the issues to the mental illness and grief, that her problems are entirely the ones of her own brain rather than ones of economic anxiety or stress. <br/><br/>In summation, I walked away with this pretty impressed. The 4/5 division is a toss-up, but the ending and a little drag in the middle kept this one on the lower end of the two ratings.","day_read": "2021/03/08"},"ducks,_newburyport": {"title": "Ducks, Newburyport", "author": "Lucy Ellmann", "stars": "5", "review": "The first of Mike's Big Books 2021. If they all take this long it might be one of only two or three. You never realize how much space paragraph breaks and dialogue take up in a book until you read a book completely lacking them. Also contains very prominent Ohio representation, which we must love and respect in all forms.<br/><br/>An exercise in style first and foremost, this novel with the exception of interludes takes the form of one long sentence, broken up only by 'the fact thats,' consisting mostly of the internal monologue and word associations of an unnamed Ohio housewife. It never plunges into full nonsensical digression like Joyce would, committed to the perspective it inhabits, but there are page long lists of every river they can think of, long digressions on Little House in the Prairie, and enough word association games to make you feel like it might be nonsense anyway. That being said, I found the prose to really work for me, not necessarily because of brilliant individual clauses but because of the way they all flowed together. I am almost always entirely rhythm deaf when it comes to reading (or at least not actively conscious of rhythm), only really noticing it if something's particularly clunky (looking at you, Ernest Cline), but man are there passages of this that flow together beautifully and cohere into much more than sum of the parts because of the way they roll off the tongue (or the brain, in this case). If you can get past the original shock of the way this is written, Ducks, Newburyport is actually pretty easy to slide into and enjoy and will almost certainly enter your own head and monologue at some point. <br/><br/>The interludes themselves are pretty unremarkable, following a mountain lion, but they primarily work as a contrast to the flowing prose of the narrator, a series of quick, terse, to the point page long interruptions. The contrast is simple- the mountain lion is worried about two things, getting her next meal and taking care of her cubs, while our housewife is worried about any number of things at any given time- school shooters, Open Carry guys, whether she is permanently broken by her mother's death, the relationship dynamics of classic movies she watches while she bakes, her own shyness, Trump's relationship with Melania whether she's a good mother, whether she neglected her eldest daughter while she was dating her now husband, the extinction of various species of animals, whether her kid's will inherit her shyness, et cetera et cetera. The point is rather obvious, that the age of information is too overwhelming for any human to process healthily, it all spurting out of us in the form of various neuroses and pet concerns and favorite books and movies through which we see our own lives through the lens of. <br/><br/>The narration doesn't feel real but it does feel <i>true</i>, hyperreal, an exaggerated reflection of our own familiar thought processes, our own inability to handle the waves of information that cascade toward us everyday, the inability to identify any real sort of signal from the noise of modern reality taken to an absurd conclusion. That being said, this is not disrespectful to its narrator (or at least I do not perceive it to be). If anything, it is a celebration of her perspective, one that would usually be perceived as 'boring', especially in the literary world: a housewife, mother of 4, who stays at home all day baking. There are points where this goes from abstract digression about something or another (i.e., what you would stereotypically expect a housewife to do all day) to something emotional from her past that are breathtaking in the way they transition and the amount of emotion they leave the reader with because of the way it breaks up an otherwise mundane part of her existence. This book clearly holds that this perspective, that the internal monologue and the lives of the 'boring,' is as worthy of respect, as interesting a collection of idiosyncrasies and personal tragedies, grand successes and tragic failures, as any other perspective.  <br/><br/>At least a part of this is an elevation of domestic labor, on the difficulties of it as well as the dignity of it. Our housewife spends most of her time either baking, cleaning up after her children, or taking care of her children, and it makes you feel and understand the amount of time and effort that goes into managing a household without real help from her husband (her husband is mostly away on work travel throughout this). I spent a number of pages of this wanting to apologize to my mother for not helping around the house more when I was a kid. <br/><br/>All that being said, interpreting this and saying any of it definitively can feel like a bit of a fruitless exercise. This many pages with this much packed in and not much didacticism to be found makes this at least somewhat of a rorschach test for the reader, which can be obnoxious if done poorly but this works well and there's enough there to leave plenty to chew on and wrestle with it.<br/><br/>I did really enjoy it but the 1000 pages is quite intimidating. I was into it for most of its length but  there weren't points where I was a little fed up. If I'm being honest, you can probably read the first 150 pages and the last 150 pages and get 85% of the same experience, which makes that probably my recommendation for people not already 100% sold by the description of the novel.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/>Still split on the ending of this one. Feels simultaneously like the only way this book could end and also like the author flinching away from their own premise. The latter because this book spends 950 pages dedicated almost entirely to the narrator's interior life, her perspective, the way she sees her day to day life, to the point of basically being a book without a plot, that to end on what is basically an action set piece feels like almost a copout. The former because while nothing really happens, there are a number of small disasters happening throughout the book, and this is a book that primarily finds itself in the narrator's worries it only makes sense that her biggest ones become manifest at the end. The more I think about it the more I lean toward a positive view of the ending. The horrors and atrocities we've inflicted on the natural world are coming quickly for the human one in ways big and small, and the coming awfulness and the excitement that comes with it may be the only thing that breaks our neurotic information-infested existence.","day_read": "2021/03/01"},"minor_characters": {"title": "Minor Characters: A Beat Memoir", "author": "Joyce Johnson", "stars": "3", "review": "Enjoyed this one for it's more down to Earth portrayal of the Beats and their art scene, a more sober, reflective view on them rather than the mad-dashing craziness of their own work during the time period. Reveals the Kerouac that you see in his works beyond all of the bluster and ambitions, a man scared of his own desires, afraid to sit still for longer than a few days, never satisfied, never content, a sad man terrified to open himself up in any real way while still maintaining some of his magnetism, his appeal, and his zeal for life. Johnson does a good job portraying all of this and his impact on her without bitterness but with honesty and tenderness. Most prominently focused on Johnson and her own escape from the confines of 1950s womanhood and the home she found in the Beats/New York, even though she was marginalized artistically and treated differently because she was a woman. Overall, a good read for a fan of the Beats to get another perspective other than the main players or for someone interested in womanhood/women in the arts of the time period.","day_read": "2021/01/29"},"do_androids": {"title": "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", "author": "Philip K. Dick", "stars": "5", "review": "Finished in one sitting, which I don't really do anymore, so this clearly has a lot going for it.<br/><br/>The prose here is a level up from my first exposure to PKD in Ubik, the barren landscapes and hard-boiled cityscapes finally measuring up to the ideas laden behind them. The paranoia coming off every page is palpable, even when the hunt for the escaped androids isn't front and center in the narrative, as it's not just the hunt that makes these people frightened and untrusting, but the conditions that have made Earth a hellish landscape and the inability to readily distinguish man from machine, to distinguish any sort of true motives. There's some weird dialogue choices here, lots of characters talking about people (or androids) directly in front of them, but that heightens the mood here, the paranoia, the breakdown of basic trust and our social norms in any interaction. The 'fake' police department and the accusations of the other bounty hunter is another instance that builds up the confusion in the reader and makes them distrustful even as the characters themselves move past those moments.<br/><br/>The world of Do Androids Dream? is one of decay, and more specifically man-made decay. The robots with their four year lifespans, Deckard's relationship with his wife, the world itself with any animals and humanity itself choking on dust, the buildings, even our simulacra of those animals, everything in here is falling apart, atrophied, collapsed. Everything is dying, dead, past the point of saving, and the characters here are left to make something out of Earth's last gasps. The accepted response to this decay and collapse being a machine that dictates your brain chemicals and mood and a retreat into television and your apartment feels (almost too) prescient, with antidepressant use on the rise as the contradictions and misery wrought by capitalism wreak havoc on the population and in-home technology isolates people further from one another. <br/><br/>The other central concern here is empathy. The androids don't feel empathy, not towards each other, particularly not towards man. The people apparently do, as dictated by the Empathy test and their interaction with the Mercer machine, where they plug in and feel the pain of a man climbing a hill having rocks chucked at him. The androids can't interact with this machine, and think separating man from this machine, and thus from religion, will make them just like them, cold, calculating, relatively unfeeling. But even as the religion is exposed as a fraud, the people don't seem to care, the literal truth of the religion not mattering beyond what it provides to them, what is denied to the androids, the empathy and community and sharing they feel inside the machine mattering more to them than the literal truth of the matter. And the androids aren't necessarily locked in their true nature, either; Racheal's final motion of destroying his goat in anger and the relationship with Deckard, seems to imply that they may have the capacity for empathy, for something beyond cool calculation, themselves. ","day_read": "2021/01/17"},"the_raw": {"title": "The Raw Shark Texts", "author": "Steven  Hall", "stars": "2", "review": "Found this one quite disappointing. Memento by way of the style of House of Leaves sounds right up my alley, but this one fell quite short of that mark. <br/><br/>The biggest problem is the tonal whiplash- I am on the record as not a fan of Whedon-esque quips, but there are places where they have their use and their function. In my opinion, they do not belong in your horror-adjacent book about a killer theoretical shark that seems to want to ramp up its atmosphere by using ergodic elements but undercuts any tension that they build by quippy dialogue or a look between characters that communicates their desire to fuck. I'm all for authors getting horned up in their work, but there's a time and place where it adds to atmosphere and a time and place where it ruins any tension you've built. This is the latter.<br/><br/>As for the ergodic elements, here it all felt a little tacked on, not as intricate a part of the work as House of Leaves where every single piece relies on the intertextuality and the disorienting assault of footnotes, book flippings, and assorted images associated with the texts. Here it's used sparingly, and most of the moments are downright unnecessary (did I really need the picture of the QWERTY keyboard to illustrate all this?). The 60 page shark attack worked for me, but other than that Hall's experimentations feel more like window dressings, a hook, a gimmick, than something necessary to the text. <br/><br/>That being said, there's interesting ideas here, the idea of our words and ideas and memories having lives beyond our heads, beyond the pages they're written on, this idea of the flow of information and it existing in a metaphysical sense rather than just the physical sense of letters or the Internet or sound waves, and the idea that there are animals/forces beyond our comprehension following this flow seeking to swallow them whole and take them from us. And beyond just the central threat of the shark, there is some interesting theoretical stuff going on here; the dialectical nature of Hall's reflections on memory and the people you hold only in memory, whether they're just a pale shadow of themselves, empty words on the page, not themselves the second you think back or write them down, or if they're living, breathing in your mind, something to interact and guide you even in their literal physical absence. I just wish Hall was more interested in these ideas and developing them further rather than the romance element of the books. SPOILERS Even if the romance is essential to the ending here, there's ways to sell this without it feeling like a Marvel movie, in ways that Sanderson reconnecting with the ghost of his dead wife adds to the atmosphere and ideas, not subtracts. END SPOILERS And perhaps he felt his ideas starting to fray, losing the thread of them, their meaning entirely swallowed by a Ludovician if he lingered and exploring them longer, but that leads to a novel that feels at best an experiment that doesn't quite succeed. <br/><br/>Overall, there's things to like here, but there's a 100 page middle section that just drags before rebounding into something more interesting. Without that section, the experience of this book might totally be different, but I can only reflect on the words that made it on the page. In my estimation, he loses sight of what I consider important here (the ideas, the atmosphere, the horror) in favor of things I'm not all that interested in (the characters and their relationships), and that knocks this down a few pegs. Your mileage and experience may vary.","day_read": "2021/01/15"},"the_last": {"title": "The Last Nautilean and Other Seaside Phantasmagoria", "author": "Perry Ruhland", "stars": "5", "review": "","day_read": "2021/01/07"},"the_city": {"title": "The City & the City", "author": "China Miéville", "stars": "5", "review": "2021 getting its real start with a bang. This was incredible, going straight into the favorites.<br/><br/>For a work of 'weird' fiction (or at least one by one of the preeminent writers of the 'New Weird'), this is remarkably restrained, both in its prose and its concepts. And to be honest, the novel greatly benefits from it- even as the concepts get a bit more gonzo as it progresses, the levelheaded narration of Inspector Borlu keeps everything in balance, keeps the progression and ideas first. For fans of the more purpley prose or Lovecraftian aspects of the Weird this might come as a disappointment, but keeping everything so in check emphasizes the Kafkaesque nightmare of bureaucracy and invisible walls and borders and the mind games of following the rules regulating what you see, what you hear, your very perception of the world. This is a crime novel first and foremost (or, at least, Mieville says it is), and at least stylistically it strays closer to that than his own past works.<br/><br/>As for the titular cities, Mieville ruthlessly probes the conceit for all its worth, from how it affects tourists, refugees, immigrants, to how it affects chasing criminals. It would be easy for Mieville, a Marxist, to get overtly political/dialetical/revolutionary with this idea of people trained to deny the truth directly in front of their eyes, but that's not what he's interested in here, even if there are plenty of nationalists and Social Democrats to be found here. He's interested in what this denial does to the psyche, what living with that contradiction everyday does, what the maintenance of those beliefs does in a society open to outsiders. And in the end, he finds the truth that everyone who's seen the truth ends up in: once you've seen the contradictions, the two sides of the city, there's no turning back, there's no 'unseeing' ever again. You can choose to work to enforce them, to be coopted into the upholding of the blindess, or you face life outside (some would say in that third city, Orciny), on the run, hunted and ostracized. <br/><br/>As for the plot, it opens up in perfect sync with the concepts, the reader learning more and more about the case as they also learn more about Breach and the dynamics between the cities. There's still enough mystery left in the end to leave readers with some things to cling to in the end, but plenty solved as to not be unsatisfying. SPOILERS The wrap of the case reveals the irrelevance of all these inter country machinations in the face of big business, of extractive capitalism. Whatever politicians are brought to justice and abuses uncovered, the law can no longer fix the economic systems that have overpowered them. Borlu ends up sticking with Breach in spite of its irrelevance and him 'seeing' it; I guess there are certain things you can 'unsee,' when your own livelihood still depends on it. The last chapter implies he's going to liberalize Breach, going to make it more modern, rely less on intimidation and more on tech, which feels almost tongue in cheek from Mieville, as if he's mocking the end result of his own character, that until one can check capitalism machinations there is only endless retooling and variations on the same systems. From any other author, it might feel like a bad or unsatisfying ending, but from Mieville, it feels intentional, an acknowledgement of his own place in the economic system and the powerlessness we all have in changing it.

But Cline is too earnest, too unimaginative, too excited by the possibilities he outlines- the truth is, he looks at a world where humanity has failed and there's no stopping climate change and poverty envelops nearly everyone and so everyone has retreated into virtual spaces and he celebrates it, because the world now looks just like him, locked inside, playing video games. He plays at saying that's it bad to live your life virtually in the end, saying the only things that matter are in the real world, but you can feel he doesn't mean it- Wade only internalizes it and accepts it because he has a hot gamer girl waiting at the end of the tunnel (er, Maze that looks just like the one in that one 80s video game!). The rest of this is filled with such contempt for humanity as a whole (Wade at one point gets himself locked up in a techno-slavery camp and within a week is already talking about how much he hates all the other slaves in the camp, and when his actions lead to the death of his aunt and uncle he spends maybe a paragraph lightly mourning) and ideas at world improvement so vague and handwavey (the idea of fixing poverty and the climate and the world is brought up, but the only solution proposed is throwing money at world hunger, and Wade actually wants to just fly off in a spaceship with movies and games and leave the rest of the world behind) that can you feel Cline sighing and saying he needs to put it in there even if he's not interested in any of it. There's a sincere version of this that works that communicates the message that escapes from reality are dangerous and we need to engage with the problems of the day rather than retreating into culture and an ironic, almost satirical version that reveals the ugly innards of a life mediated entirely online, but this falls far short of either of those.<br/><br/>Have to say it, if there's one thing we've learned in the 9 years since Ready Player One, it's that the overly sincere, passionate, devoted nerd fans of major IP aren't opposed to the inhuman profit motivated corporations churning out slop and seeking to destroy it, but actively campaigning for it, advocating for it, harassing anyone who even mentions the fact that what they're producing is garbage. The entire plotline of this of the pure of heart nerds rising up to take down the corporations seeking to profitize your childhood, the things that give you pleasure, feels almost hokey- if anything, they would be celebrating it, defending it, encouraging it along on its path of destruction.<br/><br/>The prose here is obviously dire, reading either like an excited 6th grader telling you about the video game boss he just beat or a SparkNotes summary of itself. There's no life, no sensory detail- as a matter of fact, most of the description is just pointing to a property that's it referencing and saying it looks just like that. No imagination, no feeling, no desire to craft something new. There's plenty of room for pastiche, but spelling out references to every 80s movie isn't pastiche, it's plagiarism. The characters themselves are fairly lifeless and inert, Wade a male gamer self-insert, Artemis the hot gamer chick, the two Japanese samurai guys. One of them has an interesting backstory- a black lesbian woman playing in VR as a white man to escape the oppressions of the real world, but Cline has no interest in exploring that, tossing it aside in favor of more digressions about the virtues of 80s culture, saying her race doesn't really matter at all (although to be fair, I'm not sure anyone needs to hear him try to talk about racism, either).<br/><br/>There is a lengthy section in here that does talk in detail about how all of humanity's greatest accomplishments, from Thomas Edison to Marie Curie, came about because of masturbation, so there's that, too.","day_read": "2021/01/02"},"neuromancer_(sprawl,": {"title": "Neuromancer (Sprawl, #1)", "author": "William Gibson", "stars": "5", "review": "Obviously a debut novel in that it's so bursting with ideas that it can sometimes get lost in them (and some of the descriptions that are a little over the top), but given it's only 292 pages that's forgivable. The blueprint of most all science fiction to follow, which can make it almost a trite read 35 years later but Gibson's vision is compelling enough to carry it even if it's been regurgitated at you in bit and pieces of media of varying quality ever since. Even if it doesn't feel original now, it still feels cool, and that's arguably more important.<br/><br/>Gibson's characters are largely hollowed out shells, alienated from the world and each other by a hyper competitive dog kill dog world and increasingly technological spaces that makes human connection undesirable or worse, a weakness. Case's central drive isn't because the quest to free Wintermute means anything to him or he loves Molly or any human consideration- it's simply so he can retain his connection to the matrix, this thrilling alternate world, this 'hallucination.' These people's interests have been reduced to survival, to a job, their relationships transactional, diffuse, 'useful' but not ultimately meaningful. The AI storyline plays almost as side dressing, a question of which corporate master you will serve- Case and the book itself seems to be uncommitted, even uninterested on whether the success or failure of the mission is moral or good, just a changing of hands of power in the increasingly abstracted and less human halls of power, something that may make no difference at all in anyone's material conditions.<br/><br/>Gibson is not afraid to lose you in slang of the world and hyper-complex descriptions, and there will be paragraphs you have to puzzle over, but it's far better than the alternative of overexposition. I've heard people describe the matrix as the closest analog to the Internet because all the details are wrong but the underlying feeling is right, the overwhelming amounts of information flying at you, the feeling of possibility there even as the reality of its place in hypercapitalist society is inescapable.

At the end Tokarczuk also points to an important truth, that a world where Animals aren't valued for anything other than their pelt or their meat it's a natural step to devalue the Oddballs of our own kind, those who fall outside the realm of capitalist production or familial reproduction, and that retributive violence is a potential outlet to attempt to reclaim one's own value and avenge the disregard by those in power. The main character's narration form something of a reflection on the nature of solitude, on the way it attunes one to their surroundings, to an appreciation of the finer details of the people that they do have in their life and to the crowds they find themselves in, and to how it enables one to lean into ones quirks, interests, and causes (even if the cause is murder). The trick of this one- that even as the killer in this murder mystery is narrating the story, and she mentions that no one will suspect her because she's a 'crazy' old lady, you still don't suspect her until late in the game because she's an old lady (or at least I didn't really; I considered it but didn't quite believe it). <br/><br/>A better dog murder revenge story than John Wick.","day_read": "2020/12/15"},"ubik": {"title": "Ubik", "author": "Philip K.

The details of the world of Ubik and the asides at the start of each chapter paint a dystopian picture of a commodified world, one where it costs a nickel to open your front door and where the religious can be sold (or used to sell) any product you can imagine.
